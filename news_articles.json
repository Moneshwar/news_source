        "content": "Key events\nShow key events only\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n55 mins: Liverpool win a corner, and prepare several substitutions. They’ll take the corner first.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.17 BST\n54 mins: Liverpool are pushing for a third here. Salah crosses from the right into a defender’s arm, very similar to the moment that presented Liverpool with their matchwinning penalty at Burnley, but this time the arm wasn’t unnaturally extended, and play continues.\nShare\n53 mins: And that’s Raspadori’s final involvement in the game, as he makes way for Koke.\nShare\n52 mins: Good work from Atletico on their right and eventually they work it to Raspadori, who gets enough space to shoot and doesn’t hesitate. But at that point he’s at an unpromisingly acute angle, and Alisson saves.\nShare\n50 mins: After lengthy build-up on the left Robertson crosses, and the referee sees/imagines a very gentle push from Isak on a defender. On the touchline, Koke is preparing to come on for Atletico.\nShare\n46 mins: No halftimely changes, so Isak plays on, for now. I’ve had a few emails about the Atletico goal, and whether it should have been disallowed for offside against Antoine Griezmann, whose run into the area had carried him beyond the defence to a position just in front of Alisson. “I know it’s constantly changing, but from the looks of it Griezman was standing straight in front of Alisson and obscuring his line of vision from an offside position when that goal went in,” writes Samuel Dodson (and 10,482 others). “Trust the officials made the right call but has something changed with the rules around interfering with play?” No rule changes, I can’t imagine VAR didn’t consider the possibility (OK, I can imagine, but I’ll make a charitable assumption), but Marco Di Bello must have decided that Alisson had sight of the ball when the shot was taken.\nShare\n46 mins: Peeeeep! And they’re off!\nShare\nThe players are back out, and Atleti are preparing for kick-off.\nShare\nTwo minutes away from being a brilliantly encouraging half for Liverpool, but even so a good one. Partly because Mo Salah has looked like Mo Salah, for the first time in the three Liverpool games I’ve seen this season, and partly because Isak, who grew into the half from a slow start, has obviously none of his silkiness on his journey from Newcastle. But the game remains very much unwon, which for the neutrals among us is probably ideal. “Atléti looked so flat before pulling one back,” says Kari Tulinius. “Now they look like they have the fire inside them. Simeone has a reputation for stirring half-time talks, but he won’t need to do much to have them roar out of the traps at the restart.”\nShare\nHalf time: Liverpool 2-1 Atlético de Madrid\n45+5 mins: The free-kick is lifted into the penalty area, bounces out of play and that’s it for a very entertaining opening half.\nShare\n45+5 mins: Lenglet brings down Gravenberch on halfway and is booked.\nShare\nGOAL! Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid (Llorente, 45+3 mins)\nGame on! A nice move from the away side, with Giacomo Raspadori timing his run from deep perfectly and passing infield to Llorente, who takes an imperfect touch that works out nicely as he stretches and toe-pokes through Konate’s legs and inside the far post.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.00 BST\n45+1 mins: Another Atletico corner starts stoppage time, of which there’ll be about four minutes.\nShare\n43 mins: Nearly a wonderful third! Wirtz to Isak, Isak’s lovely pass back to Wirtz, he touches wide of the advancing Oblak but just behind the run of Frimpong, who therefore can’t turn it into an empty net. At the pace Frimpong runs, there’s really not a lot of margin for error.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.16 BST\n41 mins: Now Robertson passes from the left in to Isak, who spins, makes space, and shoots. Things are starting to happen for him, but all that happens this time is an easy save by Oblak.\nShare\n40 mins: Save! A big loopy ball forward drops just over the defender’s head and right onto Salah’s boot, but he volleys at Oblak.\nShare\n39 mins: Wirtz passes to Isak on the edge of the area. It’s not a great pass, but Isak’s first touch is great, he spins, and sends a shot just wide.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.49 BST\n38 mins: A lovely first-time touch from Salah to kill the pace of a ball fizzed into him and lay it into Wirtz’s path. As Tim Stappard writes, “looks like Salah has decided to earn his wages for once”.\nShare\nNo penalty\n36 mins: The referee takes another look, and common sense prevails. Corner kick.\nShare\nPenalty to Liverpool (for now)!\n35 mins: Now Frimpong is played into the area, his cross hits the sliding Lenglet and bounces off his body into his arm (probably). The referee has given a penalty for handball, but it’s patently absurd and he’ll surely change his mind when he’s told to take another look.\nShare\n34 mins: Frimpong makes an excellent and very rapid run into the area, but Gravenberch chooses not to pass to him. But then …\nShare\n31 mins: Isak plays a first-time pass infield to Salah and is absolutely wiped out as by Le Normand he does so. Salah goes on and shoots at Oblak, Le Normand is booked, Isak requires the physio.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.36 BST\n30 mins: ... and now it’s 2-1, Cole Palmer pulling one back. At Anfield Atletico continue to exert gentle pressure. Griezmann sends in an excellent low cross which runs through the area and out the other side.\nShare\n29 mins: Meanwhile in Munich Chelsea are two goals down, an own-goal (from Chalobah) and a penalty (from Kane).\nShare\n25 mins: The play has been concentrated around Liverpool’s penalty area for the last few minutes. Atletico win another corner, their fifth.\nShare\n23 mins: Atletico have come out of their shells a little bit, as given the scoreline they must, and Giuliano Simeone turns a poor cross into the box into something very different by magnificently controlling it, but his cross is cut out.\nShare\n21 mins: Salah cuts infield from the right and from the edge of the penalty area curls a shot towards the far post that misses it, but not by much.\nShare\n20 mins: Szoboszlai’s dodgy pass almost plays Raspadori in, but Gravenberch deals with it. Mary Waltz emails from California. “Everton fan here rooting for more Liverpool goals,” she writes. “I have not turned red. I just want them feeling fat and happy going into Saturdays fixture. Everton’s only hope is that Liverpool will take victory for granted and will be suffering hangovers.” As plans go it has a certain Baldrickian cunning to it, I suppose.\nShare\n17 mins: A shot on target from Atletico! Raspadori has it, left-footed and from 20-something yards. It is poorly struck, and rolls into Alisson’s arms.\nShare\n15 mins: Atletico win a corner, which Van Dijk heads clear. On the touchline, Simeone is absolutely losing his nut about something. What the something is is unclear.\nShare\n14 mins: Isak has done very little so far, but then he’s found in space on the left and silkily progresses to the edge of the area, before his pass infield is intercepted.\nShare\n12 mins: Griezmann plays a lovely first-time pass round the corner as Atletico work the ball out of defence. The lad’s still got it.\nShare\n10 mins: Atletico win a corner, and curl it into Alisson’s arms. Liverpool have had 75% of possession so far.\nShare\n7 mins: Salah cuts in from the right, passes infield to Gravenberch, takes an excellent return pass played under pressure, holds off two defenders and slides in a low finish. An excellent goal. The goals were divided by 126 seconds.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.18 BST\nGOAL! Liverpool 2-0 Atletico Madrid (Salah, 6 mins)\nAtletico surrender the ball straight from the restart and the next time they touch it it’s back in their net!\nShare\nGOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Atletico Madrid (Robertson, 4 mins)\nAnd it’s in! Salah sends in a low shot, it flicks off the back of Robertson’s calf, the left-back having relocated into the mixer, and Oblak is wrongfooted!\nShare\nUpdated at 20.35 BST\n3 mins: Gravenberch sees Lenglet coming towards him at pace, knocks the ball into touch and goes down on the edge of the Atletico area. He had no chance of catching the ball after he kicked it, but he was fouled. Robertson and Salah stand over the ball.\nShare\n1 min: Peeeeeeeep! Liverpool kick off, Van Dijk pumps it long, and Isak loses his first aerial challenge as a Liverpool player.\nShare\nRight then, the preambles have been entirely and completely completed, and as soon as Liverpool break from their huddle we can get on with kicking off.\nShare\nThe players are in the tunnel. The crowd have assuaged their lonely-walk-based fears. Not much stands between us and football.\nShare\nInevitable Norwegian/English translation fail: Christian Svanes Kolding gets in touch to point out that Fet does not, as I ludicrously asserted, mean oily at all. “Your faithful half-Norwegian/half-Danish minute-by-minute enthusiast who is marooned in southern California would like to correct you,” he writes. “Fet does not mean oily but greasy. The word itself comes from the word fat - like the fat of a Czech goose that’s been cooked!”\nIt finished Slavia Prague 2-2 Bodo/Glimt, so the Czech goose wasn’t exactly cooked but probably has a hamstring injury or something. The Norwegians also missed a penalty.\nShare\nI have received some footage of Alexander Isak warming up! He’s the bloke on the far left. Yeah, that’s it, the one over there. Please, calm yourself.\nShare\nPafos had a man sent off in the 26th minute, so they’ll probably take an away point. Which they have now secured. They’re still playing in Prague, 10 minutes into stoppage time.\nShare\nOf the two early Champions League kick-offs one has been pretty dull (Olympiakos 0-0 Pafos, deep into stoppage time) and the other one has been anything but (Slavia Prague, who were 2-0 up with 16 minutes to play, 2-2 Bodo/Glimt, for whom Sondre Fet has snaffled a last-minute equaliser. Fet, apparently, is Norwegian for oily.\nShare\nArne Slot suggests Isak will play 45-60 minutes today:\nThis was the plan all along. That’s why he wasn’t involved in the Burnley game, so he could have a few proper sessions. That’s what you do in preseason as well, you don’t start playing friendlies you start with a proper training week. That was the plan all the way.\nI think for Alex No9 is by far his best position. In the past he played as a winger as well but then he started to grow more and more. Hugo could be a player who plays off the left side, not in the way Cody or Mo is playing, but he could become a second striker. But in general I think both of them are more No9s than another position.\nShare\n“Seeing images of the crowd tonight really takes me back to that final game before lockdown,” writes Edan Tal. “Having a big crowd is so normal again now, it’s funny to remember that gut-wrench feeling of seeing so many people so packed brought at the time.” Yeah, that was a weird night alright. As it happens, Andy Robertson has just been asked about it on the telly:\nIt was a madness game. I think the next day we all went into lockdown, which was even more madness. It’s going to be another difficult game but we believe if we do the right things we can get the right result.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.04 BST\nThe teams!\nThe teams are in, and here they are. Isak starts in attack for Liverpool!\nLiverpool: Alisson, Frimpong, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson, Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo, Isak. Subs: Mamardashvili, Woodman, Gomez, Endo, Mac Allister, Bradley, Leoni, Ngumoha, Danns, Kerkez, Ekitike.\nAtletico Madrid: Oblak, Llorente, Le Normand, Lenglet, Galan, Simeone, Barrios, Gallagher, Gonzalez, Raspadori, Griezmann. Subs: Musso, Esquivel, Sorloth, Martin, Molina, Pubill, Seidu, Belaid, Ruggeri, Hancko, Koke.\nReferee: Maurizio Mariani (Italy).\nWill Unwin is at Anfield for us tonight, and here’s his reaction:\nEveryone is waiting for their first glimpse of Alexander Isak in a Liverpool shirt. The fans will be pleased to see him starting, while Arne Slot will be eager to see how long he can last. The Liverpool head coach guarantees that the £125m will not last 90 minutes against Atletico Madrid but also knows he needs a shift from the forward because a win against the Spanish side is vital in what is a difficult Champions League group stage on paper for the Reds. They will face Eintracht Frankfurt, Internazionale, Real Madrid and PSV before Christmas, so a positive start is required.\nAtletico Madrid have won once in four La Liga games so far this season, so Liverpool will be confident considering their 100% Premier League record. Diego Simeone, however, will not make things easy for the English champions, making it a potentially fascinating encounter.\nShare\nHello world!\nAnd also, happy birthday Arne Slot! But how happy will that birthday be? Well, Atletico are currently 11th in their league with five points from their first four games, while Liverpool are top of theirs with 12 points from the same number of matches, which seems promising. Plus the Spaniards have five first-team players missing through injury, three ruled out by problems picked up in Saturday’s 2-0 home win against Villarreal. Less encouraging in many ways was Diego Simeone’s almost Bondvillainesque assertion that “we have the intention of bringing the game to where we want it to go”.\nAtletico’s injury list includes including their star striker, Julian Alvarez. Liverpool’s squad includes their own star striker, Alexander Isak, who is expected to start the game on the bench, is not expected to end it there, and is expected to be the myopic focus of pre-match chatter.\nTalking of which, here’s Will Unwin’s report on yesterday’s pre-match chatter, from both Slot and Virgil van Dijk:\nArne Slot has said Liverpool have exceeded his expectations by winning their opening four Premier League matches but must improve as they start their Champions League campaign on Wednesday at home against Atlético Madrid.\nLiverpool’s perfect start has them top but they have won each game late, becoming the first Premier League side to win four consecutive matches with goals scored after the 80th minute. The results follow the death of Diogo Jota and more than £400m of signings designed to make the squad more suited to Slot’s vision. “I think we are far above my expectations from during this summer,” Slot said.\nMuch more here:\nShare",

The paper described a sexually suggestive letter that reportedly bore Trump’s name.\nMurdoch, 94, has also had a difficult relationship with the royal family in recent times. Earlier this year, the Duke of Sussex received an “unequivocal apology” from his News Group Newspapers (NGN) after “serious intrusion” by The Sun, including unlawful activities by private investigators working for the paper, as Harry and the publisher settled their high court case.\nHis brother, the Prince of Wales, reached a settlement with NGN over hacking claims in 2020, court documents suggested.\nPer PA, Murdoch was sitting on the same side of the table as the Queen and William, but much further down to their left. He was seated between Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and Murdoch’s fifth wife Elena Murdoch.\nThe king is seated in the middle of the table, between Trump and US secretary of state Marco Rubio, while the Princess of Wales is on Trump’s other side.\nOn the opposite side of the table is the Queen, who is between first lady Melania Trump and US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, while the William is on her other side.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.34 BST",

        "content": "Key events\nShow key events only\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n57 min: Laimer and Kane link and it’s a huge chance for Kane! Laimer has burst from halfway, Kane makes a perceptive overlapping run, and is slid in cleverly by his teammate. Sanchez’s positioning is good, though: he makes himself big and comes off his line to block a low shot from the England captain. Kane remonstrates with himself for not creating a two-goal cushion.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.19 BST\n55 min: Chelsea’s Caicedo is putting in a good shift, he gets his foot on it in midfield, and plays a searching pass forward which Bayern’s defence does well to cut out.\nDiaz then has a sniff for the hosts, cutting in on his right foot, and sliding a shot straight at Sanchez from an angle.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.16 BST\n52 min: A nice bit of interplay from Chelsea’s tricky forward line creates a chance for James to shoot from distance. It’s a bit of a scuffed effort from the Blues captain, who is playing in midfield tonight, and it’s easily saved.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.13 BST\n50 min: Stanisic is going to come off, it seems. It was a heavy landing after he jumped with Chalobah, not that the Chelsea player did anything wrong. And there it is: the Frenchman Sacha Boey comes on, Stanisic off.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.11 BST\n48 min: Gusto made a raid on the right early doors, chasing a long ball for Chelsea, but was offside. Now Bayern’s Stanisic has gone down, looking in some pain, after falling awkwardly after an aerial challenge with Chalobah around halfway.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.09 BST\nSecond half kick-off!\nOne change for Bayern: Tah, who had been booked, replaced by Kim.\n“Kim is a little bit tighter as a defender, if I may say,” observes Hoddle on commentary.\nWill we see Nicolas Jackson soon?\nShare\nUpdated at 21.06 BST\nChampions League-related half-time reading:\nShare\nHalf time: Bayern Munich 2-1 Chelsea.\nHelluva good half of football.\nShare\n45 min + 1: Olise again makes a few inroads down the Bayern right, and wins yet another corner. Sanchez catches it, this time, and that’s that.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.49 BST\n45 min: More pressure from Bayern – Tah with a header at the far post – but he’s offside. Another excellent high line from Chelsea brings the assistant’s flag. We will have a minimum of two minutes added.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.48 BST\n44 min: Olise stands Cucurella up on the Bayern right. He wins a corner. One final chance before the break? Sanchez tips it clear – or does he try to catch it? Anyway it’s another corner over the other side, to be taken by Kimmich.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.46 BST\n42 min: A corner for Bayern is half-cleared by a Sanchez punch. Olise hits it first-time on the volley, from the edge of the box, and it bounces wide of the far post. Close …\nShare\nUpdated at 20.45 BST\n39 min: Now Bayern’s Gnabry curls a fine cross over from the right looking for Diaz. He tumbles over while going for it, under a challenge, but the referee waves away Bayern protests. This is a fine game of football. Adarabioyo then has to block a shot from Kane, who tries one from point-blank range at an angle.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.43 BST\n38 min: Laimer, suddenly, has a sight of goal for Bayern after a marauding run into the box and an excellent pass by Olise. He slides his shot, side-footed, to the far post and it drifts wide. Will this be 2-2 or 3-1 at half time? It looks like it has another goal in it before the oranges and tea.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.41 BST\n35 min: James, playing out of position in midfield, embarks on a strong diagonal run in the middle of the park. Chelsea remain full of energy. Gusto now powers to the edge of the box and slams a shot straight into a defender! Bayern don’t look comfortable with these Chelsea runners seemingly coming from everywhere. A marginal penalty is what separates the teams, but Chelsea look the more dangerous side again.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.39 BST\n34 min: Chelsea are back into this. Caicedo hits a shot well wide when there are better options. Maresca, who must have been close to seeing a red card such was his fury about something, seems to have settled down a bit, too. That goal by Palmer has got them right back in it when a cricket score was suddenly looming.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.36 BST\n33 min: In other news, Cucurella is being booed by the Bayern fans over a handball that wasn’t given at Euro 2024:\nShare\n31 min: “Some players don’t know how to use space,” says Hoddle on commentary, of Palmer’s rich talents. “This kid does.\n“He just lent him (Gusto) the ball, hoping he was going to give it back.”\nLovely stuff.\nShare\nGoal! 28 min: Bayern Munich 2-1 Chelsea (Palmer)\nWhat a sensational finish by Palmer. Caicedo releases him near the Chelsea penalty area. Palmer glides downfield, exchanges passes with Gusto on the edge of the box, and clips a ludicrously dead-eyed finish beyond Neuer and into the roof of the net. What a goal! Meanwhile, Maresca is furious about something, and is booked.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.53 BST\nGoal! 27 min: Bayern Munich 2-0 Chelsea (Kane penalty)\nKane, of course, slides the penalty efficiently into the corner, and Chelsea are staring down the barrel now.\nShare\nUpdated at 21.08 BST\nPenalty to Bayern!\nKane goes down under a challenge from Caicedo. The referee initially doesn’t give it. Then he does. Classic Kane trickery. Was it a foul? Not for me Clive.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.41 BST\n24 min: The good news for Chelsea is that, as stated, they were the better team before the goal. However, you sense Bayern will feel they’ve steadied the ship and can revert to type when it comes to home matches at the Allianz.\nShare\nGoal! 20 min: Bayern Munich 1-0 Chelsea (Chalobah OG)\nWonderful work from Olise on the right, and it looks like an own-goal by Chalobah. After Bayern’s free-kick ricocheted off the ref, it was restarted with (I think) a drop ball. The former Crystal Palace forward was soon one-on-one with Pedro and he skinned him with ease. Then he put a low ball across the face of goal and Chalobah turned it into his own net with Dayot Upemecano lurking. Did Chelsea switch off a touch after that free-kick was retaken?\nShare\nUpdated at 21.10 BST\n19 min: Bayern suddenly have Chelsea where they want them, streaming forward and massing their ranks around the penalty area. Gnabry has a shot blocked, and again the defensive hunger from Chelsea is excellent. The hosts have a free-kick about 30 yards out. Kimmich tries to slide it diagonally but it hits the referee’s boot and it’s a drop ball.\nShare\n17 min: Pedro is clattered by Tah as he tries to turn away from his marker. It’s a handy position for a free-kick, halfway inside the Bayern half, but they play it backwards. Neto makes a run on the left, chasing a ball from Cucurella, but Pedro is caught offside in the process.\nShare\n14 min: Palmer turns superbly around halfway, using his skill and power. He lofts a good-looking ball for Neto on the left but it’s cut out. Bayern then win a free-kick for a handball at very close quarters, that is clearly accidental, and on commentary Glenn Hoddle insists the law is a nonsense – before Bayern take the set-piece.\nBayern take it short, Olise clips a cross to the far post, but Chelsea step up and several home players are offside when the cross comes over. Again, Chelsea look the better-coached side based on that little exchange.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.18 BST\n10 min: Bayern’s players look just slightly rattled by Chelsea’s high-tempo opening. Now they get a foot on it – Stanisic plays inside for Kane, who can’t control – then Gnabry makes a perky run on the left and hammers a shot wide from outside the area.\nChelsea come again, down the right, where they are getting a lot of joy against Tah and Stanisic. And yet again they attack down that side, winning a corner, that leads to a headed chance for Cucurella! The former Brighton man nods it wide. Chelsea are significantly the better team here after nearly a quarter of an hour.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.15 BST\n7 min: Huge chance for Chelsea! They slice Bayern open down the right with worrying ease from the hosts’ point of view. Palmer plays a typically astute low ball across to Fernandes, by the penalty spot, who should probably hit it first time, but chooses a touch and is then crowded out by his marker. I think a flag was up anyway. Then, at the other end, Kane has a header from a Diaz cross, but it’s a long way from goal, a quarter-chance at best.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.10 BST\n5 min: It’s been a bright start from Chelsea. They’ve been instructed to press the ball at every opportunity, and Bayern are not being allowed a chance to settle. The energy level from Maresca’s side is very good but can they keep this intensity up?\nLiverpool are 2-0 up already.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.21 BST\n2 min: Chelsea look keen to press straight away. Bayern move the ball out of defence, but Chelsea win it back, and the goalie Robert Sánchez drills an excellent long ball from the back into the path of an on-rushing João Pedro, on the right. He crosses, an awkward one bouncing towards the penalty spot, and it’s a big chance – but no one can get on the end of it. Chelsea appeal for a handball, too, but nothing doing.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.05 BST\nFirst half kick-off\nAllez! Bayern get things started.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.02 BST\nChelsea players huddle before the start. A big night for Maresca, his debut as a coach in the Champions League.\nShare\nBayern’s front four have 18 goals between them in this campaign, after just five games. Kane has eight of those. Are they going to get medieval on Chelsea here?\nShare\nThe teams are lined up on the pitch. Massive Bayern Munich flags are being waved all over the shop. João Pedro, leading the line for Chelsea this evening, points to the sky as he walks out of the tunnel looking ultra-focused.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.27 BST\nLouise Taylor\nIt is only two years since Eddie Howe attended his first Champions League match but now Newcastle’s manager is on a mission to disrupt Europe’s elite.\nAs Barcelona arrived on Tyneside on Wednesday Hansi Flick’s La Liga champions certainly displayed no sign of complacency. Indeed Flick warned of the “intensity” his players must be braced for at St James’ Park on Thursday night.\nShare\nThe beginning of the game is important, then. That said, the middle and the end are going to be equally crucial.\nLess than 10 minutes until kick-off!\nShare\nUpdated at 19.54 BST\nEnzo Maresca speaks to TNT Sports. Is this a similar lineup and approach to the Club World Cup final win against Paris Saint-Germain?\n“Levi [Colwill] is out. Tosin [Adarabioyo] will replace him,” Maresca says, comparing the lineups.\n“Two different games, two different teams – we don’t expect from them what we expected from PSG.”\nIs the first 10, 15 minutes important tonight, to quieten the crowd?\n“It’s very important. The beginning of the game, the first 10 mins, 15 mins. But then 90mins, 100mins. But for sure, the beginning is very important tonight.\n“They are a very good team. Like I said yesterday, the are one of the favourites to win the competition. At the same time, any team can have some weaknesses, and we will try to exploit them.”\nIs the pressure on Bayern?\n“No, I feel pressure. As a Chelsea player of manager, you have a duty to win all the games. Yeah, we’re going to try and win the game.”\nShare\nUpdated at 19.54 BST\nFormations-wise, both sides may line up in a 4-2-3-1. As they mentioned in punditry, that Chelsea forward lineup is pretty flexible, though.\nShare\nJust think, if we’d not had a solid 90 minutes to build up on this blog, we might never have known that Felix Magath played chess against Garry Kasparov in 1985.\nShare\n“Fully expecting us (Chelsea) to get tanked this evening by a very strong Bayern side,” emails Matt. “Olise is a superb player and feels like one that got away (anyone would think the club is only interested in signing players with whom the sporting directors have longstanding historical relationships, though who knows why that might be the case…).\n“I’d feel a lot happier had we kept Jackson rather than having [Marc] Guiu on the bench, who has looked like a Vanarama player whenever I have seen him play. 3-0 to the Germans, if we’re lucky.”\nThanks for your email, Matt. Good luck.\nShare\nHarry Kane has scored eight goals and has three assists in five matches for Bayern this season. That’s sensational! But maybe some of the opposition was not.\n“We feel very good right now, it’s going to be a great game under the lights,” he said.\nShare\nAs Jacob mentions in that story, Mourinho would be back at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday 30 September for a Champions League tie, if he and Benfica agree a deal.\nShare\nJacob Steinberg\nBenfica are closing in on the appointment of José Mourinho after sacking Bruno Lage in the wake of their defeat by Qarabag in the Champions League.\nMourinho is on the market after leaving Fenerbahce last month and is in advanced talks over a return to his former club, whom he briefly managed in 2000.\nShare\n“Last season was disappointing,” Harry Kane said yesterday, of Bayern’s quarter-final exit against Inter. “It’s about building on that and hopefully we can go all the way.\n“Being here at Bayern there is a big expectation around the Champions League. There is a lot of excitement, and we have a great game at the Allianz to try and get off to a good start.\n“With Michael [Olise], the second year, I feel our relationship is getting stronger and stronger … Nico [Jackson] shows a lot of great attributes, if we can get the best out of him, he’ll be a great asset this year.”\nShare\nUpdated at 19.24 BST\nLiverpool are also in action this evening, and Simon Burnton is blogging their curtain-raiser against Atlético Madrid, right here:\nShare\nHargreaves just mentioned Felix Magath, the former manager, who was not happy when Bayern Munich lost to Chelsea in 2004/05. A couple of Wiki snippets here:\n“Magath is the son of a Puerto Rican former soldier in the US Army stationed in Aschaffenburg … Magath is a chess enthusiast, an interest which he developed during the 1978 World Chess Championship, while he was bedridden due to hepatitis. In 1985, he played in a simultaneous exhibition against Garry Kasparov.”\nEvery day is a school day.\nShare\nUpdated at 19.14 BST\nPlease do email me with your thoughts.\nShare\nThe TNT Sports pundits Cole and Owen Hargreaves, who played in the 2004/05 tie between these sides, are reminiscing about José Mourinho hiding in a laundry basket to give a team talk, due to a Uefa touchline ban.\nShare\n“This is what it’s all about,” says pundit Joe Cole of tonight’s mouthwatering clash, which is a fair point.\nShare\nTeam news\nJackson is on the bench for Bayern, who are unchanged from the 5-0 win against Hamburg. Palmer starts for Chelsea, and is one of four changes made by Maresca: Marc Cucurella, Reece James and Malo Gusto also come into the side.\nMichael Olise and Luis Díaz are a couple of other former Premier League players starting for Bayern ce soir.\nBayern Munich: Neuer, Laimer, Upamecano, Tah, Stanisic, Kimmich, Pavlovic, Olise, Gnabry, Diaz, Kane.

Yet James is not ­worried about Chelsea’s lack of experience and accepts that July’s triumph in the Club World Cup means they are contenders to become ­European champions.\nShare\n“First of all, you know since last season, I always like to go game by game,’ the Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca revealed on Tuesday, in another jaw-dropping development. “You cannot think about the final or semi-final if you can’t win games in the group stage.\n“We have the first one against a fantastic team, one of the three or four favourites in this competition, but we are going to try to do our job in the best way.\n“I think Bayern Munich is a team that showed last year that they are very close and they can compete to win this competition. This is my view. I see them together with three or four more clubs as one of the favourites for this competition.”\nShare\nUpdated at 18.56 BST\nJacob Steinberg\nA trip to the Allianz Arena offers Chelsea fond memories of the greatest night in their history, a meeting with two what‑might‑have-beens and a swift reunion with a player desperate to prove they were wrong to let him go.\nPerhaps Enzo Maresca will be feeling nervous if his team have to face Nicolas Jackson when they open their Champions League campaign against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night. There are plenty of examples of loanees coming back to haunt their parent club in the tournament and Jackson will not be short of motivation if he features against Chelsea less than a month since he left on loan.\nShare\nWhat’s the vibe on the old team news? Well, Cole Palmer is expected to slot into Chelsea’s starting lineup after a groin injury, which is nice for Blues fans and neutrals alike, because he is well good at playing football.\nBayern remain without long-term absentees Alphonso Davies (cruciate ligament), Hiroki Ito (metatarsal fracture) and Jamal Musiala (dislocated ankle and fractured fibula). Raphaël Guerreiro was injured in the 5-0 win against Hamburg on Saturday, and is ruled out, although Kompany said his stomach muscle injury is “not serious” and he might be back for Hoffenheim on Saturday. Also nice.\nShare\nUpdated at 18.45 BST\n“We want to win the Champions League, everyone’s 100 per cent up for this competition,” revealed the Bayern Munich manager Vincent Kompany on Tuesday, in a quite astonishing development.\n“We’ve developed momentum,” Kompany added. “We’ve fulfilled all the to-dos. We’re looking forward to a Champions League night at the Allianz Arena. That’s always special.”\nShare\nPreamble\n“It’s the greatest night in Chelsea’s history,” commentator Clive Tydesley memorably said as Didier Drogba belted the Champions League-winning penalty past Manuel Neuer in 2012. “These are the moments Chelsea will always cherish and never forget,” wrote Daniel Taylor. There has been plenty of water under the bridge since that magical night in Munich, but that remains indubitably true.\nChelsea won it again in 2021 under Thomas Tuchel, of course, while as far as these opponents are concerned, they were thrashed 7-1 on aggregate in a last-16 tie back in 2019/20. The six previous matches between the clubs have produced four goals each on average – the Blues edged through 7-6 on aggregate in a quarter-final in 2004/05 – so more of the same, please.\nThe most interesting sub-plot tonight is the possible involvement of the forward Nicolas Jackson, who forced through a loan move to Bavaria from Chelsea during the summer transfer window, and by the admission of the visiting players knows “exactly the way we approach games”.\nThe mighty Bayern have a perfect five wins out of five this season while Chelsea are not exactly in a bad moment, and are unbeaten in five after their summer Club World Cup glory. It’s chance for both to make a statement of some sort, and it might even be fun!\nKick-off: 8pm UK time.\nShare\nUpdated at 18.35 BST",

        "content": "From 2h ago\nFed cuts interest rate by a quarter point\nThe Fed just announced an interest rate cut by a quarter point, which was largely anticipated amid a weakening labor market.\nThis is the first time the Fed has cut rates since December 2024. Rates now stand at a range of 4% to 4.25%, the lowest since November 2022.\nStay tuned for a press conference Fed chair Jerome Powell is expected to give at 2.30pm ET.\nShare\nUpdated at 19.43 BST\nKey events\nShow key events only\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\nSummary\nThe US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point today, a move that will reverberate across the economy in the coming months. Fed chair Jerome Powell spoke at a closely watched press conference about the Fed’s decision.\nHere’s a summary of what happened this afternoon:\nThe Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point, the first cut since December 2024. Rates are now at a range of 4% to 4.25%.\nFed economists also released projections, which point to a majority expecting at least one more rate cut by the end of the year.\nDuring his press conference, Powell said the rate cut was a move toward “risk management” instead of a testament to the strength of the economy. Economists at the Fed are concerned about a weakening labor market, which could see higher layoffs if worsened.\nBut Fed officials are still concerned about inflation. Powell said that prices are likely to continue going up toward the end of the year as companies pass along the price of tariffs to consumers.\nA question remains: Will tariff-related inflation be a one-time price increase, or will it be persistent? Powell said economists at the Fed expect it to be more of a one-time price increase but that the Fed’s just is to make sure it’s not persistent.\nWith pressure from the labor market and prices, Powell described it as an “unusual” situation for the Fed to manage. “Our tools can’t do two things at once,” he said.\nPowell also took questions about the recent appointment of Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was confirmed by the Senate on Monday. Powell assured that the Fed’s independence is a priority to the entire committee that sets interest rates. And the Fed’s structure offers protection: For a single member to have outsized influence, they need to “make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s understanding of the economy… That’s in the DNA of the institution.”\nShare\nPowell responded to a question about comments new Fed governor Stephen Miran made at his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate earlier this week.\nMiran said that the Fed actually has a “third mandate”, which is to “moderate long-term interest rates”.\nThe introduction of a third mandate is in opposition to how Powell has framed the Fed’s “dual mandate” – balancing unemployment and price increases.\n“We always think of it as the dual mandate,” Powell said, explaining that moderate interest rates come from stable inflation.\n“As far as I’m concerned, there’s no thought of … incorporating that in a different way,” he said.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.49 BST\nMarkets appear to be relatively unresponsiveness to the Fed’s highly anticipated rate cut. Both the S&P and Nasdaq are both slightly down for the day, while the Dow is up.\nIt’s a stark contrast to last week, when markets shot up at data that showed wholesale prices falling slightly in August, and consumer inflation being within expectations for the month.\nThe overall picture that Powell has painted of the economy in his press conference isn’t necessarily one that’s thriving. Powell said that the economy has left the Fed in an “unusual” situation, and said that the Fed’s rate cut is more about “risk management” rather than an testament to a strong economy. The recent rate cut could cause inflation to rise, but risks of the job market worsening under current rates are higher.\n“We’ve seen much more challenging economic times from a policy standpoint, the standpoint of what we’re trying to accomplish, it’s challenging to know what to do,” Powell said. “There are no risk-free paths now.”\nShare\nPowell suggests only 'really strong arguments' not politics can move Fed board decisions\nPowell was, again, questioned about Stephen Miran’s role as both a new Fed governor and Trump’s chair to the Council of Economic Advisor.\nA reporter asked Powell how the Fed can be nonpolitical if one of its voting members is explicitly connected to politics. Powell emphasized that there are 12 voting members and 19 total participants on the board.\n“The only way for any voter to really move things around is to be incredibly persuasive, and the only way to do that in the context in which we work is to make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s understanding of the economy,” Powell said. “That’s really all that matters. … That’s in the DNA of the institution, that’s not going to change.”\nShare\nUpdated at 20.52 BST\nA Politico reporter asked Powell how Americans will be able to tell if the Fed, which has historically been nonpartisan, starts to be partisan.\n“We don’t frame these questions at all or see them in terms of political outcomes. In another part of Washington, everything is seen through the lens of does it help or hurt this political party, this politicians,” Powell said. “That’s the framework. People find it hard to believe that’s not at all the way we think about things at the Fed. We take a longer perspective, we’re trying to serve the American people as best as we can.”\n“I think you would be able to tell. I don’t think we’ll ever get to that place.”\nWhen asked about Fed governor Lisa Cook’s lawsuit against Donald Trump for her firing (a court reinstated her last week), Powell said: “I see it as a court case that I would see as inappropriate for me to comment on.”\nShare\nPowell said that Fed officials are expecting inflation from tariffs to be a one-time price level increase, though “we can’t just assume that, [and] or job is to make sure that’s what happens.”\n“We continue to expect it to move up,” Powell said of prices. “Maybe not as high as we would have expected it to.”\nHe added that the case for “persistent inflation” is weaker.\nWhich is why the Fed cut rates, what he described as a “neutral” policy, given that inflation isn’t out of control, but the labor market has slowed down.\nBut Powell acknowledged that it’s “an unusual situation” – the Fed would most likely want to be more careful with rate cuts because of inflation, but has to be wary of the labor market.\n“Our tools can’t do two things at once,” he said.\nShare\nPowell describes labor market as being in a 'curious balance' as demand is down at same time as worker supply dropped\nPowell is again describing the labor market as being in a “curious balance” – a term that he first used in his Jackson Hole speech last month.\nThe labor market is balanced out, meaning that the supply of workers is on par with the demand that employers have for workers, but it’s not necessarily a sign of strength.\nBecause of immigration, “the supply of workers is coming down”, Powell noted. “At the same time, demand for workers has come down quite sharply to the point where we see what I’ve called a ‘curious balance’.”\n“Typically, when we say things are in balance that sounds good,” he added. “But in this case, the balance is because both demand and supply have come down sharply, now demand is coming down more sharply because we now see the unemployment rate going up.”\nShare\nUpdated at 20.51 BST\nA reporter asked Jerome Powell about Stephen Miran’s appointment, specifically on the fact that Miran is the first Fed governor to also have a role in the executive branch while also serving on the Fed board. Miran is the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors.\n“The committee remains united in pursuing our dual mandate goals,” Powell said in response. “We’re strongly committed to maintaining our independence and beyond that, I really don’t have anything to share.”\nShare\nPowell holds press conference on rate cut decision\nFed chair Jerome Powell just started his press conference on the Fed’s rate cut decision.\nAs outlined in the board’s statement, Powell said that the unemployment rate, while still generally low, has edged up.\n“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” he said.\nPowell pointed to new immigration policy as a major factor in the labor market slowdown.\n“A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation,” Powell said. “Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the breakeven rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant.”\nThe median projection for the unemployment rate, which is currently at 4.3%, sees it rising to 4.5% by the end of the year.\nPowells also said higher tariffs have begun to push up some prices in some categories of goods, though the full impact have yet to be seen. Price increases due to tariffs could be a one-time price increase or it could lead to “persistent” inflation.\n“Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time price increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said.\nMuch of this is what Powell said during his speech last month at the Fed’s symposium in Jackson Hole, during which he first suggested that the Fed was looking toward an interest rate cut.\nShare\nUpdated at 19.39 BST\nIn economic projections released after the Fed’s rate-cute decision, members of the Fed’s board submitted their economic predictions for the economy over the next few years.\nA slight majority of board members seem to expect another rate cut by the end of the year, while a majority see more rate cuts in 2026. Board members are predicting a slight increase in unemployment, though they seem to think that inflation will largely cool in 2026 and 2027.\nIt’s a more dovish take on the economy than how the Fed is describing the current economy in its board statement, where the Fed said that the labor market has slowed and inflation is going up – a dynamic that points to an economic condition known as stagflation.\nShare\nBefore Fed chair Jerome Powell can expand on the Fed’s decision in his 2.30pm ET press conference, right now we just have the Fed’s statement on its rate cut to parse through why officials voted for a cut.\nNotably, the Fed’s rate-setting board took note of the jobs market.\n“Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low,” it said. It also noted that “inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated”.\nThis is a change from the board’s last meeting in July, when it said that labor market conditions “remain solid”. And this is the first time the board has said inflation is going up.\nThe statement also noted that Stephen Miran, Trump’s appointee to the board who was confirmed on Monday, was the only member of the board to vote against the rate cut. Miran wanted to lower rates by a half-point, instead of a quarter-point.\nShare\nUpdated at 19.44 BST\nFed cuts interest rate by a quarter point\nThe Fed just announced an interest rate cut by a quarter point, which was largely anticipated amid a weakening labor market.\nThis is the first time the Fed has cut rates since December 2024. Rates now stand at a range of 4% to 4.25%, the lowest since November 2022.\nStay tuned for a press conference Fed chair Jerome Powell is expected to give at 2.30pm ET.\nShare\nUpdated at 19.43 BST\nInflation rose slightly in August as companies continued to push the cost of tariffs on to consumers.\nThe newest update to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods and services, showed that prices increased 2.9% over the last year – the highest since January. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July.\nDespite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from Donald Trump to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the US jobs market is weakening.\nInvestors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%.\nShare\nThe Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated last month that the central bank was gearing up to cut interest rates for the first time this year.\nFor months, policymakers defied public calls from Trump to lower rates – and brushed off his increasingly aggressive criticism of the Fed’s decision to hold them steady.\n“With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said in a closely scrutinized speech at the Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, highlighting a “challenging” dichotomy of risks: that Trump’s tariffs might increase inflation, while his immigration policies knock the US labor market.\nConcerning economic signs, including data indicating that the labor market has stalled while inflation picked up, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully in the months ahead.\nTrump has already suggested that he will be unhappy with the modest cut the Fed is widely expected to unveil later. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform early on Monday, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”\nShare\nCallum Jones\nThe Trump administration’s extraordinary bid to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor appointed by Biden, and remove her from the central bank’s board before this meeting, has so far failed.\nLate on Monday, a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s request to block Cook from attending the Fed’s latest rate-setting session, which started yesterday.\nThe president cited unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud as he attempted to fire Cook, who has denied wrongdoing and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038.\nNo president has pursued such action – and moved to dismiss a governor at the Fed, which has long been independent from political interference – since the central bank’s founding in 1913.\nTrump has made no secret of his hopes to increase his oversight of the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.\nShare\nCallum Jones\nThe Trump administration raced to strengthen its influence over the Fed ahead of this week’s meeting.\nStephen Miran, a senior official who served as chair of the White House council of economic advisers, was confirmed by Senate Republicans as a Fed governor on Monday evening, and formally sworn in on Tuesday.\nHis appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch will also work at the highest levels of the central bank.\nWhile Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.\nShare",

He answered questions from lawmakers about the department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\nIn several exchanges Patel sparred with Democratic representatives. When congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland – who also serves as the committee’s ranking member – asked why Patel had not released the full tranche of Epstein records, the FBI director said he was hamstrung by recent court orders preventing him from doing so. “I’m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,” Patel said.\nRaskin also played clips of Patel on a podcast where he urged the Biden administration to “put on your big boy pants” and release Epstein’s so called “client list”. Patel had previously claimed that the FBI was in possession of the list.\nMore broadly, Raskin denigrated Patel’s management of the FBI, including the firing of senior officials for, what they claim, are politically motivated reasons. “You share [J Edgar] Hoover’s dangerous obsession with blind loyalty over professionalism,” Raskin said. “For you, it’s blind loyalty to Donald Trump and keeping his secrets.”\nLater, California congressman Eric Swalwell, also a Democrat, went back and forth with Patel over whether he spoke to attorney general Pam Bondi about the president’s name appearing in the Epstein files. When Swalwell pushed Patel for answer, the FBI director snapped back with an unrelated diatribe: “Why don’t you try serving your constituency by focusing on reducing violent crime in this country, and the number of pedophiles that are illegally harbored in your sancturary cities in California.”\nAfter Swalwell attempted to discuss Patel’s history of listing several “political enemies” for investigation, the FBI director said: “I’m going to borrow your terminology and call bullshit on your entire career in Congress. It has been a disgrace to the American people.”\nShare\nJosé Olivares\nA group of 95 members of Congress have written a letter to Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, condemning the arrest of protected immigrants known as Dreamers and demanding to know how many have been detained and deported in recent months.\nIn a letter shared with the Guardian and submitted to Noem on Wednesday morning, Democratic representatives denounced the recent rise in the wrongful detention and deportation of immigrants residing in the US under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program.\nThe representatives’ letter is also addressed to Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the federal agency tasked with carrying out the Trump administration’s mass deportation program.\nIn the letter, co-written by House members Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Sylvia Garcia of Texas and backed up by the dozens of other signatories, the representatives condemned the “blatant disregard” of the protections afforded to people under Daca.\nThe members of Congress also included various examples of the detention and even deportation in the second Trump administration of Daca recipients, who are known as Dreamers after the Dream Act, legislation first introduced in 2001 to protect a large group of undocumented people who had been brought to the US as children.\nShare\nLucy Campbell\nAs Donald Trump’s second state visit to the UK continues, guests are due to start arriving for the state banquet shortly, with the dinner expected about 3.30pm EST/8.30pm BST, to top off a day off pomp, pageantry and parades in Windsor.\nPrime minister Keir Starmer will want to make the most of the face time with Trump, with the aim of this unprecedented visit to keep relations sweet with the administration, as opposed to securing any immediate big-ticket deals or international agreements.\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch is expected to meet the president for the first time. And a number of American business leaders, who accompanied Trump on Air Force One yesterday, will also attend the dinner, as the UK government tries to court investment and boost growth. Among those expected are Apple’s Tim Cook, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Open AI’s Sam Altman.\nBoth King Charles and Donald Trump are expected to deliver short speeches at today’s banquet.\nYou can follow the latest developments at our dedicated live blog below:\nShare\nUpdated at 20.36 BST\nPer my last post, classes at Utah Valley University have resumed today – one week after Charlie Kirk’s murder on campus.\nFollowing the shooting on 10 September, the university closed and students and faculty were sent home.

This comes after the news that Tyler Robinson, the man charged with killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, used Discord to communicate that he had killed Kirk.\nComer added that the leaders of these platforms must appear before lawmakers to explain “what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purpose”.\nAt a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday, FBI director Kash Patel said that the department was investigating other members of the Discord group chat in which Robinson was providing updates.\nShare\nUpdated at 20.39 BST\nThe Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by a quarter point – the first time in nearly a year. Rates now stand between 4% and 4.25%, the lowest since November 2022.\nFed chair Jerome Powell is due to host a press conference at around 2:30pm ET where our business blog will be bringing you all the details:\nShare\nUpdated at 19.28 BST\nEdward Helmore\nBarack Obama addressed the recent killing of Charlie Kirk and told a crowd in Pennsylvania on Tuesday the country was “at an inflection point”, but that political violence “is not new” and “has happened at certain periods” in US history.\nObama added that despite history, political violence was “anathema to what it means to be a democratic country”.\nThe former president made the remarks at the Jefferson Educational Society, a non-profit in Erie, Pennsylvania. He explicitly denounced political violence, addressing the fatal attacks this year of Kirk and the Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman. He called both incidents “a tragedy” and said that Donald Trump has further divided the country rather than work to bring people together.\n“There are no ifs, ands or buts about it, the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,” he said.\nFor the full story, click here:\nShare\nInterim Summary\nWith the hearing of fired CDC director Susan Monarez and fomer public health official Debra Houry now over, here’s a look at today’s key developments so far – both on Capitol Hill and beyond:\nSusan Monarez said that there had been “several explanations” about her removal from the top role at the CDC. “I had refused to commit to approving vaccine recommendations without evidence, fire career officials without cause or resign,” she said, adding: I told the secretary that if he believed he could not trust me, he could fire me … I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity.”\nAsked by Senator Bernie Sanders why she refused to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations without seeing them or the evidence behind them, the former CDC director explained that it wasn’t negotiable. “I refused to do it because I have built a career on scientific integrity, and my worst fear was that I would then be in a position of approving something that would reduce access of life-saving vaccines to children and others who need them,” she said.\nBoth Monarez and Houry expressed their concerns about the decisions that the vaccine advisory committee meeting tomorrow will make. “I know that the medical community has raised concerns about whether or not, again, they have the commensurate backgrounds to be able to understand the data and the evidence and to evaluate it appropriately.” Meanwhile Houry said she had “significant concerns” as the public had not been able to weigh in.\nHealth secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr did not express condolences for the police officer killed at the CDC shooting, Monarez said. David Rose was the police officer who was killed during the recent shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The perpetrator had blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal.\nHoury also called for Kennedy’s resignation. Speaking at the hearing, she said: “After seeing his Senate finance testimony, and the number of misstatements, seeing what he has asked our scientists to do, and to compromise our integrity, and the children that have died under his watch, I think he should resign.”\nThe Trump administration is using civil rights laws to wage a campaign against the University of California in an attempt to curtail academic freedom and undermine free speech, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by faculty, staff, student organizations and every labor union representing UC workers. The lawsuit comes weeks after the Trump administration fined the University of California, Los Angeles $1.2bn and froze research funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus and other civil rights violations.\nThe Trump administration has aggressively rolled back efforts across the federal government to combat human trafficking, a Guardian investigation has found. The sweeping retreat threatens to negate decades of progress in the drive to prevent sexual slavery, forced labor and child sexual exploitation, according to legal experts, former government officials and anti-trafficking advocates.\nShare\nUpdated at 18.52 BST\nCassidy closes hearing by debunking vaccine misinformation\nAs he brought the hearing with fired CDC director Susan Monarez, and former public health official Debra Houry to a close, Republican chair Bill Cassidy spoke about his years as a practising physician, specializing in liver issues.\nHe noted that in Thursday’s vaccine advisory panel meeting, ending the recommendation for the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is reportedly set for discussion.\n“Why should a child be vaccinated for a sexually transmitted disease when they’re at birth? The child passes through the birth canal and is exposed to the same secretions of one would otherwise, and that passage through the birth canal makes that child vulnerable to the virus being transmitted,” Cassidy said. “If that child is infected at birth, more than 90% of them develop chronic, lifelong infection.”\nCassidy summarized the impact of the vaccine on infection rates in the decades following the approval of a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. “Now, fewer than 20 babies per year get hepatitis B from their mother,” he added. “That is an accomplishment to make America healthy again, and we should stand up and salute the people that made that decision, because there’s people who would otherwise be dead if those mothers were not given that option to have their child vaccinated.”\nShare\nUpdated at 18.28 BST\nHoury says that Kennedy should resign\nDr Debra Houry just said that Robert F Kennedy Jr should resign.\nAfter seeing his Senate finance testimony, and the number of misstatements, seeing what he has asked our scientists to do, and to compromise our integrity, and the children that have died under his watch, I think he should resign.\nShare\nUpdated at 18.20 BST\nAnd another update on that front. Senator Cassidy has just said that Senator Mullin told reporters that “he was mistaken” in saying that the meeting between secretary Kennedy and Dr Monarez on 25 August was recorded.\n“But in case he’s mistaken, that he was mistaken,” Cassidy said, invoking laughter from those in the hearing room. “If there is a recording, it should be released, and would beg the question of what other conversations were recorded.”\nShare\nUpdated at 18.04 BST\nPer my earlier post, where senator Mullin made claims that Monarez was lying about her meeting with Kennedy – where she told him that if he felt she was untrustworthy he could fire her.\nRepublican senator Bill Cassidy – the committee chair – has called out Mullin’s “implication” that he has a recording of that meeting.\n“I will note that if materials have been provided to Senator Mullin, and invoked in official committee business, they’re committee records and all other senators on the committee have the right to see those records,” he said. “This is allegiance to President Trump’s values, and so I ask that that recording be released.”\nHe added:\nI’ll also note that we put in a request for any documents or communications that would bring transparency to the situation. We have not yet received those documents. If a recording does not exist, I asked Senator Mullin to retract his line of questions.\nShare\nUpdated at 18.00 BST\nMonarez and Houry both agree that politics is driving change to vaccine recommendation\nWhen asked by Democratic senator Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, whether Dr Monarez and Dr Houry feel that politics is driving the change to vaccine recommendations, including hepatitis B vaccines, instead of science in children’s health, both former officials agree.\n“I’m thankful to Senator Cassidy for really raising hepatitis B via social media,” Houry said of the series of posts by the Republican chair of the committee, which sought to debunk misinformation around testing and the vaccine. “I think there’s a lot of moms that don’t know they have hepatitis that can then transmit it to their baby, and even the mom is hepatitis B negative, we don’t know what the home situation is.”\nShare\nUpdated at 17.51 BST\nRepublican senator Markywane Mullin, of Oklahoma, is saying that Monarez is “not being honest” about her recollection of the conversation with secretary Kennedy.\n“I tell my kids all the time, you know one thing I want from you. I can deal with any situation we walk into, as long as I know you’re being 100% honest with me,” he said.\nMullin has provided no evidence about how why he feels she is not telling the truth.\n“Your personality and your answers aren’t correct,” Mullin said in an exchange with the fired CDC director.\nShare",

        "title": "Fanatics descend on Windsor to enliven Trump’s festival of nothing",
        "content": "Never in its long and august history has the No 10 bus from Windsor to Staines (via Datchet and Wraysbury) received a welcome like this. Its passage secured by police escort, its progress followed by the world’s media, the orange single-decker trundles regally up Windsor’s high street, while onlookers crane to get a glimpse of the single pensioner conveyed within. “It’s not him,” one man mutters, a little superfluously.\nIt was that kind of a day on the banks of the Thames: lots of excitement over very little, a sideshow that felt largely peripheral to the pageantry unfolding within the sealed castle grounds. “I’m afraid nothing’s going to happen, madam,” a police officer informed a woman filming a Facebook Live video from the kerb as he shooed her a safe distance back towards the pavement.\nOf course, certain things did happen, albeit nothing of very much consequence in the grand scheme of things. People shouted things at each other. People argued over Gaza. People waved flags and brandished placards. A man in a Maga hat ate a pickled egg from the chip shop and grimaced a little. Television runners shuttled up and down Castle Hill ferrying flat whites to the on-screen talent. Drizzle drizzled.\nBut mainly Windsor was a sea of people watching other people watch things, simultaneously reassured by their physical proximity to the main event and dismayed by their inability to influence it. “We are ready for anything that will happen on or around the water,” said Sgt Lyn Smith, head of a joint operations marine unit between Thames Valley and Hampshire police. As the presidential party neared Windsor, pretty much the only thing happening near the water was a swan taking a dump.\nOf course, this festival of nothing was partly baked into the design, the logical consequence of a state visit whose guiding principle was to avoid any conceivable contact with actual people. While Trump and King Charles inspected the guard, the crowd outside was left entirely to its own devices. Little tip: if you tell a Maga supporter that his huge flag only has 49 stars on it, he’ll still be counting them half an hour later.\nEven so, everyone was here and the cameras were running, so how was everyone going to fill their broadcasts? The BBC appeared to spend most of the morning broadcasting aerial shots of the castle. “Our top story today, stone building remains upright.”\n“You can see some drops of rain on the camera there, and rain obviously has an impact on flying,” a talking head filibustered on Sky News in an attempt to explain why Trump’s helicopter was yet to take off. Clearly some alternative entertainment was required.\nStep forward: the fanatics. And they are never in short supply at events like these, drawn like moths to a media pool, obligingly filling hours of dead airtime with their antics. There was a guy dressed from head to toe in UK and US flags. There was a woman with a muzzled alsatian wrapped in a Maga vest. There was a guy who had spent two days painting a picture of Trump as a caveman, carrying King Charles on his back like a baby. There were people outside the Barbour store having blazing rows about the definition of genocide. All found a willing audience among the roving reporters hungry for copy, any copy, any kind of colour.\nAnd you realise how easily what passes for political opinion in this country is shaped by the loudest – and by extension the craziest – people. Why bother to engage in the reasoned and empirical process of unpacking the views of a normal person, teasing out the nuance, interrogating the doubt, when you can simply home in on the guy in a T-shirt that reads “Trump Was Right About Everything” and save yourself the trouble?\nPerhaps it is inevitable that any circus will attract a few clowns. But this does also seem to be a quality very specific to Trump: the unerring ability to attract outcasts and misfits wherever he goes. Let’s face it: Trump himself is just a very weird guy, the kind of specimen you imagine would result from an unfortunate nuclear accident involving a large block of orange cheese. And in a sense his entire presidency has been a kind of bat signal to the disaffected, the credulous, the conspiracy-curious, the semi-sentient. Outcasts of the world, unite. We gather at Windsor at daybreak. Wear whatever you like.\nRoyals. Police. Journalists. The Hampshire and Berkshire branches of the Trump fanclub. Was there anyone here remotely normal? “Not in Windsor,” snorted the girl behind the bar of the Horse and Groom. “They’re all too busy shouting at each other.” And perhaps there is something about this place that brings out the cosplay in everyone, a royal seat with a town grudgingly attached, a kind of Potemkin England with its waves of bunting and novelty shops, a reverie to sell the tourists. What sort of reality were we really expecting to encounter here?\nReality does still intrude, if you look hard enough. A little distance from the madding crowd, a couple of local Liberal Democrat councillors were handing out leaflets. Improve our parks and playgrounds. Replace broken streetlights. Deal with “grot spots”, whatever they are. This is the politics that actually affects people’s lives, far closer at any rate than some American president sitting in a horse-drawn carriage that nobody can see. But they’re having a tough time getting the message across. “We’re about caring for people, fixing things, looking after communities,” says Mark Wilson of the Eton and Castle ward. “But that’s not what gets clicks.”\nInside the grounds, men in funny hats were playing brass instruments. The banquet table in St George’s Hall was being laid. Outside, the crowds were dispersing. The No 10 bus was well on its way to Staines (via Datchet and Wraysbury). The woman in the Maga cap had dived into Wagamama to grab some teppanyaki. And it was impossible not to sense the gulf between these worlds, far thicker than a castle wall, worlds briefly adjacent but eternally estranged.",

        "title": "US treasury secretary reportedly made similar mortgage pledge to Lisa Cook",
        "content": "Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, previously agreed to occupy two different houses at the same time as his “principal residence”, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, an agreement similar to one Donald Trump has called mortgage fraud in his unprecedented bid to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.\nThe Bloomberg report cites Bessent’s mortgages with lender Bank of America and his pledge in 2007 to primarily occupy homes in New York and Massachusetts.\nMortgage experts told Bloomberg there was no sign of wrongdoing or proof of fraud in Bessent’s home-loan filings and said the issue highlights incongruities found in such documents.\nBank of America did not rely on Bessent’s pledges and never expected him to occupy both homes as his primary residences, Bloomberg reported, citing the mortgage documents.\n“Nearly 20 years ago, Mr Bessent’s lawyers filled out paperwork properly, the bank has confirmed it was done properly, and this nonsensical article reaches the conclusion that this was all done properly,” Bessent’s lawyer Alex Spiro said in a statement.\nThe Republican president, who appointed Bessent to the Treasury post, and members of his administration have accused Cook, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, of committing mortgage fraud before taking office, a claim Cook denies.\nCongress included provisions in the 1913 law that created the Fed to shield the central bank from political interference. Under that law, Fed governors may be removed by a president only “for cause,” though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal. No president has ever removed a Fed governor, and the law has never been tested in court. Trump has sought to remove her for cause, citing the alleged fraud.\nA US appeals court on Monday declined to allow Trump to fire her. The White House has said it will appeal the decision to the US supreme court. Trump’s Justice Department also has launched a criminal mortgage fraud inquiry into Cook, issuing grand jury subpoenas in Georgia and Michigan, Reuters previously reported.\nA loan estimate for an Atlanta home purchased by Cook showed that she had declared the property as a “vacation home”, according to a document reviewed by Reuters. The property tax authority in Ann Arbor, Michigan, also said Cook had not broken rules for tax breaks on a home there that had been declared her primary residence.\nBloomberg in its report on Wednesday pointed to similar but not identical pledges made by an attorney on Bessent’s behalf on 20 September 2007, agreeing to make a Bedford Hills, New York, house his “principal residence” over the next year as well as another house in Provincetown, Massachusetts.\n“There are people who think that President Trump is putting undue pressure on the Fed. And there are people like President Trump and myself who think that if a Fed official committed mortgage fraud, that this should be examined, and that they shouldn’t be serving as one of the nation’s leading financial regulators,” Bessent told Fox Business Network in an August 27 interview.",

        "content": "A San Francisco supervisor was recalled on Tuesday after he successfully pushed to turn a stretch of coastal highway used heavily by neighborhood motorists into a car-free park despite strong objections by some of his constituents.\nJoel Engardio became the fifth elected official in San Francisco to be ousted in a recall vote in four years. He conceded, saying in a statement that he accepted the outcome and still stood by his decision to help create a park called Sunset Dunes.\n“Sunset Dunes is a success. It’s good for the environment, good for our local economy, and it’s bringing joy to people of all ages,” Engardio wrote. “Very soon, we will wonder why this was ever a controversy. We won’t be able to imagine San Francisco without a coastal park and all the benefits it offers.”\nThe recall highlights a San Francisco in flux and a still cranky, even emboldened electorate as leaders prepare to make tough decisions about the city’s future, such as how to build more housing. And while San Francisco prides itself on its environmental values and open public spaces, people still rely on cars to get around. That’s especially true in the residential and more suburban-feeling Sunset neighborhood, which has a high population of Chinese families.\nRecall backers say Engardio failed to listen to constituent concerns about the impact that closing the Great Highway to vehicles would have on their quality of life and on traffic safety. The closed portion is entirely within the district.\nThe recall was fueled by many of the same people who tossed out three liberal school board members and the politically progressive district attorney Chesa Boudin in 2022. Engardio, a crime victims’ advocate in his first term, supported those recalls and was elected that year to a seat on the city’s board of supervisors.\nLast year, he was one of five city supervisors who placed a proposal to permanently ban cars from a 2-mile (3.2km) stretch of the Great Highway on the November 2024 ballot. Measure K passed citywide, but failed in his district. Petitioners submitted 10,500 valid signatures in May to qualify the recall attempt for Tuesday’s ballot.\nMayor Daniel Lurie, a moderate Democrat like Engardio, will name his replacement. Engardio was up for re-election next year.",

        "content": "Key events\nShow key events only\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\nRoundup: Worcestershire relegated, Leach sends Ashes message\nTanya Aldred\nRain and bad light stalked The Oval as Nottinghamshire and Surrey inched towards a denouement. There was time for Notts to add another 37 runs for the last two wickets, including a corking straight drive for four from Josh Tongue. On the next ball, though, he edged behind to Matt Fisher, who finished with 11 wickets in the match. Brett Hutton was left unbeaten on an invaluable 42 for the visitors.\nSet 315 to win, Rory Burns and Dom Sibley clinked down the pavilion steps, applauded by Surrey supporters sitting through the gloom. Burns had a lucky escape when he was fumbled at slip in Tongue’s first over, and he and Sibley saw Surrey safely through to mid-afternoon, when bad light stopped play with the hosts 66-0. The destination of the title may hinge on whether Surrey can successfully chase the remaining 249 runs on day four.\nWorcestershire’s relegation from Division One was confirmed when they failed to pick up a third batting point at Chester-le-Street. Gareth Roderick collected 151 as Worcestershire batted all day, frustrating a Durham side desperate for their own bonus points. Sussex and Hampshire, also in the relegation mix, had mixed days. A draw looks likely at weather-hit Hove, where John Simpson’s 66 gave Sussex a 38-run first-innings lead over Yorkshire, but Hampshire are in trouble at Taunton.\nThe visitors were forced to follow on against Somerset after some ripping bowling from Jack Leach, who finished with a season-best seven for 69. “I have done an Ashes tour before and it didn’t go how I would have liked, so I feel like I have got some unfinished business in Australia,” Leach said. “I would love to go as part of the current team, I love what Baz and Stokesy have created … I feel good.

Check out your county team next time and see how many you can spot - the same numbers on both sides also happens sometimes, but there you go.”\nShare",

        "title": "Breaking the Code review - tribute to Alan Turing given a fascinating update",
        "content": "When premiered in 1986, giving Derek Jacobi a key career role, Hugh Whitemore’s Breaking the Code was instrumental in spreading knowledge of the precocious brilliance of mathematician Alan Turing, whose brutal treatment by a homophobic and ungrateful state contributed to his suicide in 1954 aged 41.\nThough drawing on Andrew Hodges’ 1983 biography, Alan Turing: The Enigma, Whitemore was ahead of several later plays and movies, including Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game (2014). So, for a long time, Whitemore and Jacobi’s portrayal of Turing formed his public image, which was inevitably tragic, given that he remained a convicted criminal for loving men and his theories had not yet been fully realised.\nBut Turing is now officially pardoned and features on a British banknote in a world that owes much to him for the evolutions in digital technology and now AI (in which Turing saw both the gains and dangers). So Jesse Jones’ smart revival offers a more redemptive portrait of a true genius who lived in an age that proved fatal to him.\nStarting in a Northampton theatre 23 miles from Bletchley Park, where Turing saved British shipping by cracking German naval codes, this touring production will end in Manchester, where he died. It adds a new epilogue by Neil Bartlett, set in the present day at Sherborne School, Turing’s alma mater. The punchy, touching speech follows Ian McEwan’s 2019 novel Machines Like Me in finding a way to give Turing some degree of posthumous triumph over his destruction.\nMost important to this Turing 2.0, though, is a superb performance by Mark Edel-Hunt. It is tempting to play Turing as if he always knew he was in a tragedy but, shown extracts out of context, an audience might think this were a comedy. Edel-Hunt also delivers long speeches of mathematical and computing exposition with immaculate clarity, exuberantly suggesting the humour and sensuality that Turing found in numbers and nature, his body and tongue tangibly loosening when his great brain engages.\nActing of matching quality comes from Peter Hamilton Dyer as Dillwyn Knox, the cryptographer who recruited Turing to Bletchley; the men’s enthralling dialogues about reality and pretence are, as often in Whitemore’s writing, only fully understood in retrospect through later data. Carla Harrison-Hodge as Pat Green, a Bletchley colleague on whom Turing’s mother hopes he is sweet, radiates braininess and the pain caused to her by the play’s sub-theme of humans being harder to read than machines. Joe Usher, as two of Turing’s love interests, is especially impressive in a brilliant scene in Greece where a language barrier allows Turing to spill his secrets without truly doing so. Joseph Edwards does a nice double as a Sherborne student in the 1920s and 2020s. This is not just a revival but a fascinating reboot.",

        "title": "Federal Reserve cuts US interest rates for first time since December",
        "content": "The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday, its first rate cut since December, as the central bank moved to stabilize a wobbling labor market even as Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to push up prices.\nRates are now at a range of 4% to 4.25% – the lowest since November 2022. But the decision is unlikely to satisfy Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for acting “too late” and called for a far bigger cut.\n“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a closely watched press conference. At the same time, he warned, inflation has picked up.\nIt is “reasonable” to expect Trump’s tariffs will lead to “a one-time shift” in prices, Powell suggested. “But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,” he said. “Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”\nLast month, Trump moved to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, claiming she committed mortgage fraud by listing two properties as her primary resident on mortgage applications. But Cook has denied wrongdoing, and insisted the president has no authority to remove her.\nA federal judge and an appeals court have blocked Trump from removing Cook from her post, though the White House has appealed to the supreme court.\nAmid the fiasco, a separate Biden-appointed Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, suddenly resigned from her post in August. Republicans quickly moved to replace her with Stephen Miran, the current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. The Senate confirmed Miran on Monday.\nMiran was the lone dissenting voice on the rates decision. The Fed said he “preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting”.\nThe dilemma for the Fed is that lowering interest rates will make borrowing money cheaper, at the risk of potentially causing prices to rise.\nPowell first hinted that the central bank was leaning toward a rate cut during his speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August. At the time, Powell pointed to uncertainty around immigration and trade policy as significant sources of uncertainty for the economy.\nThe labor market, Powell said, is experiencing a “curious kind of balance” where the supply and demand for workers have slowed. He warned of “downside risks” to the jobs market that could see higher layoffs and unemployment.\nSuch risks seemed to materialize when federal jobs data for May and June showed the number of jobs added to the economy was revised down by 258,000. Though the labor market picked up slightly in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.\nAt the same time, Trump’s tariffs have caused a slow but steady increase in prices. Inflation in August climbed to 2.9% after dipping down to 2.3% in April. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that tariffs will cost households an average of $2,300.\nWhat remains unclear to economists is the nature of these tariff-related price increases: will they amount to a one-time price increase, as companies pass on tariff costs to consumers, or will the impact on inflation be more permanent?\nThe biggest concern for economists is the possibility that unemployment and prices continue to rise, which could lead to what economists call “stagflation”.",

        "title": "Shabana Mahmood accuses asylum seekers of making ‘vexatious, last-minute claims’",
        "content": "Shabana Mahmood has accused asylum seekers of making “vexatious, last-minute claims” to avoid removal to France as the Home Office said it would review modern slavery laws to save Keir Starmer’s returns deal.\nAfter an 11th-hour injunction that scuppered Labour’s “one in, one out” scheme, the home secretary said she would stop claimants “suddenly deciding that they are a modern slave on the eve of their removal”, adding that it made a “mockery of our laws and this country’s generosity”.\nHer unusually forthright words come as Keir Starmer’s government faces intense pressure from its own backbenchers and Reform UK over the issue of immigration and small boat arrivals from France.\nThe prime minister announced the returns deal in July and has fuelled expectations that rejected claimants would be sent back this week. So far, no one has been put on a flight.\nOn Tuesday, a high court ruling blocked the deportation of a 25-year-old Eritrean man who was due to be flown to Paris. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he was a victim of trafficking and would be made destitute if sent to France.\nFollowing the ruling, officials abandoned plans for a flight on Wednesday. The Home Office has announced it will appeal against the decision. Mahmood said: “Last-minute attempts to frustrate a removal are intolerable, and I will fight them at every step.\n“Migrants suddenly deciding that they are a modern slave on the eve of their removal, having never made such a claim before, make a mockery of our laws and this country’s generosity.\n“I will fight to end vexatious, last-minute claims. I will robustly defend the British public’s priorities in any court. And I will do whatever it takes to secure our border.”\nA legal source with knowledge of the case said: “The reason [trafficking claims] are last minute is because the Home Office isn’t identifying those from a known slavery route, for example via Libya, and expects vulnerable people to somehow raise it after a torrid journey.\n“They [the asylum seekers] put in late claims as they only get advice late due to the government’s own rushed detention and removal policies.”\nUnder the deal, signed in July by Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, the UK agreed to detain Channel claimants and send them back to France in return for taking a similar number of asylum seekers with family ties to the UK.\nTuesday’s high court injunction was granted after the Home Office changed its legal position on the question of whether it could accept evidence from France.\nThe unnamed man has been given extra time to submit evidence to back up his claim that he is a victim of modern slavery because he was trafficked on his journey to the UK.\nMr Justice Sheldon, who granted the temporary injunction, said more time was needed to investigate his claim that he was a potential victim of human trafficking.\nThe court was told he and his mother had travelled to Ethiopia when he was a young child and that he had been trafficked from there to Libya in 2023.\nHe said he had then made his way via Italy to France, and arrived in Britain by small boat across the Channel on 12 August after his mother paid £1,000 to smugglers, court papers said.\nThe Home Office still plans to send some failed asylum seekers to France this week, sources said. France has been planning to fly asylum seekers to the UK this Saturday as part of the agreement.\nChris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “The home secretary is reacting in panic to the collapse of her gimmick returns deal.\n“On Monday I told Shabana Mahmood in parliament that fundamental reform of human rights and other law was essential. She brushed it off, and now, for the third day in a row, flights to France have left empty. No one is fooled by tough talk from Labour.”\nIt remains unclear whether asylum seekers will come to the UK from France if reciprocal flights have failed to take off.\nA solicitor representing asylum seekers questioned why the government had taken an “arbitrary and chaotic approach” to choosing who would be removed, including mistakenly selecting children.\nImogen Townley, from the firm Wilsons, said: “There has been quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats without much consideration given, or seemingly any consideration given, to whether they are suitable for return to France.\n“You would think that the government of the UK working with France would be able to select some people, particularly in a pilot scheme when there is quite a lot of resources aimed at a small group of people.”\nCampaigners for migrant rights have called for Mahmood to scrap the scheme. Lochlinn Parker, the acting director of Detention Action, said: “The scheme has been beset with foreseeable problems. Screening for vulnerabilities and age is not working and the system designed to get people legal advice has predictably failed.\n“The only way to end this chaos and the harm it is causing people is for the government to end this deal urgently.”",

        "title": "Howe urges Newcastle to show Barcelona they are Champions League contenders",
        "content": "It is only two years since Eddie Howe attended his first Champions League match but now Newcastle’s manager is on a mission to disrupt Europe’s elite.\nAs Barcelona arrived on Tyneside on Wednesday Hansi Flick’s La Liga champions certainly displayed no sign of complacency. Indeed Flick warned of the “intensity” his players must be braced for at St James’ Park on Thursday night.\nFlick recalls Paris Saint-Germain being utterly overwhelmed here two years ago when they surrendered 4-1 to formidable yet still slightly naive opponents whose inexperience would ultimately spell group‑stage elimination. Back then Newcastle, at times, looked a little bit like wide-eyed Champions League tourists; now they want to be seen as contenders.\n“There were a lot of unknowns last time,” Howe said. “There was a feeling we were experiencing something new, we enjoyed it but ultimately we failed. So this time the resolve is stronger to progress. Not just to enjoy the experience but to try to make it a meaningful one. We’ve learned things and tried to add layers.”\nIf Newcastle’s manager has wised up considerably since he watched his first live Champions League game from San Siro’s away dugout, the creditable draw his players secured against Milan 24 months ago emphasised that Howe was not as green as he might have seemed.\nNow, as he prepares to counter the threat of Raphinha, Marcus Rashford, Frenkie de Jong and co, he has the added benefit of familiarity. “Everything that goes into a Champions League game is different from the Premier League,” Howe said.\n“It feels different, the buildup’s different. We hadn’t done that before but that experience will help us now. Our squad’s arguably stronger than it was two years ago. We’re excited. I’m looking forward to seeing how we match up against them. I’ll back our quality.”\nIt all prompts memories of another visit from Barcelona, back in mid-September 1997.\nTo mark its anniversary a very special guest is flying in from Colombia to take a seat in the directors’ box. Faustino Asprilla’s unforgettable group‑stage hat-trick against Louis van Gaal’s side at St James’ Park helped Kenny Dalglish’s Newcastle to secure a 3-2 win against the Catalans as the teams clashed in the Champions League for the first time. Given that Barcelona starting XI included Luís Figo, Rivaldo and Luis Enrique, it was some achievement.\nNow, as both sets of supporters prepare for their fifth meeting in this competition, they will also remember Sir Bobby Robson. The former England manager’s son, Mark, will, like Asprilla, be looking on from the posh seats as two of the clubs his father coached with distinction face each other for the first time since 2003.\nTwenty-two years ago Robson occupied Howe’s dugout but proved powerless to prevent Newcastle from succumbing 2-0 against his old friends from Barcelona. If Newcastle’s latest manager hopes for a different result he is not about to banish Robson’s memory.\n“There are connections with Sir Bobby that we fully embrace,” Howe said. “That’s what makes this such a special game. I might tap into the psychology of it.”\nBack in September 1997 injury kept Pep Guardiola at home in Barcelona but the absence of the generational talent otherwise known as Lamine Yamal’s on Thursday night leaves an enormous hole in Flick’s starting XI. If Howe – who said he was disappointed not to be facing the prodigy – senses opportunity, he must be mindful of an opposing manager who shares his ability to switch tactical systems with rare fluency.\nLike Howe, Flick is no slave to philosophy and, during his time in charge of Bayern Munich the now 60-year-old former Germany coach was dubbed “Flicki-Flaka”. It was a reference to his ability to combine gegenpressing with controlled possession and, at Barcelona, the apparently reborn Manchester United loanee Rashford is evidently relishing working for such a subtly flexible tactician.\nThe feeling is clearly mutual. “It’s a real luxury to have Marcus in my team,” Flick said. “He has fantastic, unbelievable, qualities.” Barcelona may need them.",

        "title": "UK to explore extraditing Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brückner",
        "content": "Mark Rowley has said the British police investigation into Madeleine McCann will explore extraditing the German national Christian Brückner to the UK to stand trial over the three-year-old’s disappearance.\nBrückner was released from a German prison on Wednesday after serving a seven-year jail term for the rape of an elderly woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2005, two years before Madeleine disappeared while on holiday with her family in the same town.\nBritish police have been formally involved since 2011 in supporting Portuguese and German efforts to solve the mystery of her disappearance.\nBritish police regard Brückner, 49, as their main suspect, as do their European counter parts. He was released from jail after an investigation did not produce enough evidence to support a charge over Madeleine’s disappearance under German law.\nRowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said: “They’ve got to a particular point in their inquiry where the prosecutor doesn’t feel they’re able to prosecute. We’re now at a stage where he remains a suspect for us. We’re taking stock.\n“The Germans have done everything they possibly can do within their law. He has a track record for very serious offences. He remains a suspect in our investigation into Madeleine McCann being missing.”\nAsked if Brückner could be extradited to face trial in the UK, Rowley said that an offence as serious as murder need not be tried in the country where the crime took place.\nRowley, Britain’s most senior police officer, said: “There are hundreds of questions. One of the reasons we are involved is that murder is in many situations extraterritorial and potentially a murder of a British subject can in certain circumstances be charged in the UK.\n“There’s lots of maybes, so at the moment we are taking stock with the Germans and Portuguese.”\nBrückner denies any blame for the disappearance of Madeleine, whose family are from Leicestershire. It emerged earlier this week that he had refused a request from the Met to interview him over the case.\nThe Met says it will continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry and that its investigation is continuing.\nThe former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, Nick Vamos, said: “Yes, it is feasible. The main obstacle is you need enough evidence to charge before you can extradite.”\nRowley oversaw British police efforts to resolve the case of Madeleine’s disappearance early in his career at the Met. He said a previous appeal involving British police had led to Brückner being identified as a suspect, which led to German police joining the investigation.\nPrivately the Met knows bringing Brückner before a British court would be unprecedented and difficult.\nRowley spoke to reporters to mark his third anniversary as commissioner. He said under his tenure the Met had carried out the biggest ever purge of corrupt and failing officers and staff in British policing history, ousting 1,400 people.\nHe said corrupt cliques still existed and more attention would be put on them as the legacy of bad officers was cleared out.\nHis comments came after revelations last week about Charing Cross police station, where allegations of excessive force, racism and misogyny came to light not as a result of the Met’s efforts, but because of a media investigation.\nNine officers have been suspended and others moved in what Rowley said was another sign of the force’s determination to root out wrongdoing.",

After flying into Portugal on Wednesday he told journalists that he has spoken to Benfica, whom he briefly ­managed in 2000.\n“What I can confirm is that, before I caught the plane, Benfica asked me if I was interested in coaching them,” he said. “I said yes. I said I was abroad and that when I returned to Portugal I would have all the interest in talking with them.\n“My nature is wanting to coach. I told myself that I wanted to balance myself emotionally. I didn’t want to say yes to the wrong club, just because I am a workaholic.\n“When asked if I wanted to coach Benfica, I did not think twice. It ­interests me.”\nBenfica acted to axe Lage after throwing away a 2-0 lead at home to Qarabag on Tuesday night.\nIt is understood the president, Rui Costa, is keen to make a big appointment before next month’s election. João Noronha Lopes, who is competing for the presidency, is reportedly keen to prise Ruben Amorim away from Manchester United.\nMourinho left Fenerbahce after failing to qualify for the league phase of the Champions League. There would be a swift return to Chelsea for him in the competition on 30 September if talks with Benfica end successfully.\nThe former Manchester United and Tottenham coach has not managed in Portugal since he left Porto in 2004 after ­guiding them to Champions League glory.\nMourinho claimed three league titles, one FA Cup and three League Cups across two spells at Chelsea and led Inter to a historic treble in 2010, winning his second European Cup with victory over Bayern Munich.\nMourinho has struggled to recapture his former glories in recent years. He won La Liga with Real Madrid in 2012 but has had a series of largely underwhelming jobs since his second spell at Chelsea came to a fiery end in 2015. He did not impress at United and Spurs, who sacked him just before facing Manchester City in the League Cup final in 2021, although he did win a League Cup and Europa League with United.\nHe secured the Conference League with Roma in 2022 but the 62-year-old’s time at Fenerbahce ended unhappily.",

        "content": "Congressional Republicans have proposed $88m in new security spending for lawmakers, judges and top government officials in response to the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, but the money has been caught up in a partisan battle over government funding that could spark a shutdown.\nThe funds are included in a stopgap measure Republicans in the House of Representatives released Tuesday that would keep the government open through 21 November without making major changes to policy, and gives negotiators time to work out a long-term deal. Under the proposal, an additional $30m would be available for security for members of Congress, another $30m would go towards protective services for executive branch employees and $28m would be spent on security for supreme court justices.\n“The tragedy has also initiated a number of uncomfortable but necessary conversations about important issues like the safety and security of our members,” Republican speaker of the House Mike Johnson said ahead of the proposal’s release on Tuesday.\nBut Democrats have hit out against the short-term funding proposal, saying they will not vote for it unless it addresses their healthcare priorities. These include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act insurance plans, and the undoing of cuts to the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans Republicans approved earlier this year as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n“The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and his House counterpart, Hakeem Jeffries, said in a joint statement on Tuesday.\nWhile Republicans can pass legislation through the House with a simple majority, Democrats can block most bills in the Senate with a filibuster, meaning the spending legislation needs at least some of their votes to advance.\n“President Trump called the play last week when he told Congressional Republicans to jam a partisan spending bill down the throats of the American people without Democratic support,” Schumer and Jeffries said, accusing Republicans of “steering our country straight toward a shutdown”.\nGOP leaders have rejected the Democratic demands. However some Republican lawmakers have expressed public concerns about the possibility of premium increases for ACA plans if the subsidies are not extended, and in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Johnson said the issue could be sorted out near the end of the year.\n“They’re trying to insert unrelated matters into the middle of a clean government extension, and I don’t think that’s going to work,” the speaker said.\n“If the government is shut down because they make that their last stand, it will solely be blamed on Democrats, because we’re not playing politics with this at all. We’re just trying to keep the lights on.”\nThe issue of increased security funding appears to have bipartisan support. At a press conference on Tuesday, House Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar described it as “something that members care about”.",

Metropolitan police had said it was aware of the video, which was circulating on social media, and was attempting to identify the man.\nA spokesperson for the Met said: “A man has been arrested in relation to a video referencing Sir Keir Starmer which was filmed during the ‘unite the kingdom’ protest on Saturday 13 September in central London.\n“On Sunday 14 September police arrested a 56-year-old man on suspicion of malicious communications. He was taken into custody and later released on bail pending further inquiries.”\nScotland Yard estimated that at least 110,000 people attended the event. A total of 26 police officers were injured in clashes as projectiles were hurled, and the Met said on Sunday that 24 people had been arrested for a range of alleged offences including common assault and violent disorder.\nThe force said a post-event investigation was under way, with officers working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests.\nSpeakers included the owner of Tesla and X, Elon Musk, who was condemned by Downing Street for using “dangerous and inflammatory” language at the event. The billionaire, who appeared via a live link, told a crowd of protesters that “violence is coming” and “you either fight back or you die”.\nMarchers had travelled to London by train and coach for a demonstration, which was billed as a “festival of free speech”, but by its conclusion had amplified racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim hate speech across Whitehall.\nThe scale of the protest vastly outgrew police estimates, resulting in tense and at times violent clashes between protesters and police.",

        "content": "Australia’s all-conquering cricket women have been given a wake-up call with their World Cup defence approaching as India handed Alyssa Healy’s side their biggest ever one-day international defeat in Punjab.\nHealy admitted the champions had been “outplayed” in New Chandigarh on Wednesday (Thursday AEST) as they suffered a 102-run loss, a thumping so heavy that it even surpassed the Australians’ previous record 92-run defeat to England in Birmingham 52 years ago.\nIt was a warning for the team with the World Cup starting in less than a fortnight in India and Sri Lanka, while also setting up a fascinating ODI series decider on Saturday in Delhi with the series locked at 1-1.\nIndia’s hero as they celebrated their first home ODI win over Australia in 18 years and 206 days was their imperious opener Smriti Mandhana, who hammered 117, featuring 14 boundaries and four sixes, off just 91 balls in their total of 292.\nAustralia had chased down a total of 281 comfortably in the first match at New Chandigarh but this time, asked to pull off their highest ever chase, never really got going as Annabel Sutherland’s 45 off 42 balls and Ellyse Perry’s 44 off 61 proved their most significant contributions in a total of 190.\nHealy had won the toss and inserted the home side in baking conditions, looking to prepare for the World Cup, and reckoned she had no regrets about doing so.\n“I mean, it’s good preparation for the World Cup, isn’t it?” she said. “You don’t get to choose every time.\n“So no regrets, not really. I just thought India were pretty good today in all facets of the game, and we probably got outplayed a little bit, but it’s good to have these opportunities, heading into do-or-die World Cup matches.”\nAustralia lacked the spark that Phoebe Litchfield had provided in the opening match with her sizzling innings of 88 as she missed the match with a low-grade quad strain.\nHer replacement Georgia Voll was out in the first over, bowled by Renuka Singh for a duck, and Australia then got bogged down amid some fine bowling by Kranti Goud, who got the key wicket of Healy, caught in the deep for nine, amid her haul of 3-29.\nEarlier, Mandhana had been severe on Australia’s attack and had it not been for the accurate offspin of Ash Gardner, the target would have been even higher.\nGardner took 2-39 in her 10 overs, the only Aussie bowler to concede less than four an over.\nYoung fast bowler Darcie Brown was also impressive, taking three late wickets (3-42) as India went on a late charge.\nTahlia McGrath enjoyed a good day in the field, dismissing Mandhana and running out Goud, but when the allrounder got caught for 16 off the spin of Deepti Sharma, who took 2-24 to go with a breezy knock of 40, Australia’s hopes were sunk.",

He was then taken to a park clinic and flown to a nearby hospital.\nPark officials said on Wednesday they had no more information including the man’s name, where he was from, and updated condition.\nIt was the park’s first bear attack since a grizzly injured a hiker in the Mammoth Hot Springs area in 2021. That hiker was able to hike out on his own.\nA grizzly killed a woman just west of Yellowstone in 2023.\nThe bear in the latest attack will not be relocated or killed because it attacked during a surprise encounter and did not exhibit unnatural behavior, according to park officials.\nDNA analysis could determine the species. The man believed it was a black bear but its location, size and behavior suggested it was a grizzly, according to the statement.\nGrizzlies and black bears can be difficult to tell apart at times. But grizzlies grow much larger – as much as twice as big – and black bears usually have darker coloring.\nGrizzlies are federally protected as a threatened species in the lower 48 US states, where their numbers have rebounded from about 700 in the 1970s to about 2,000 today.",

        "content": "Someone have a word with the chimps? Observations of the apes in the wild show them imbibing the alcoholic equivalent of a half pint of beer a day through the vast amount of fermented fruit in their diet.\nResearchers arrived at the first estimates of wild chimp daily alcohol intake after measuring ethanol levels in fallen fruit that the apes gather from the forest floor in Kibale national park in Uganda and in Taï national park in Ivory Coast.\nWhile individual fruits contained less than 0.5% alcohol, the chimps’ daily intake swelled as they devoured the ripe fruit pulp. The apes were particularly fond of figs, which contained some of the highest levels of alcohol the team recorded.\nAleksey Maro, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said at both African sites, males and females consumed about 14g of pure ethanol per day through fermented fruit. That is equivalent to one standard US drink or half a pint of 5% ABV lager.\n“The chimps are eating 5 to 10% of their body weight a day in ripe fruit, so even low concentrations yield a high daily total, a substantial dosage of alcohol,” said Prof Robert Dudley, also at UC Berkeley.\nDudley believes the chimps’ consumption of alcohol in the wild supports his “drunken monkey” hypothesis, which posits that the human penchant for drink has roots in our primate ancestors’ need for energy-rich, ripe, fermented fruit. The human attraction to alcohol probably arose from this “dietary heritage”, Maro said. Details are published in Science Advances.\nThe observations are not the first to capture chimpanzees’ booze habits. In 2015, researchers said a troop in south-eastern Guinea were the first known to indulge in regular, habitual drinking. Some of the apes started at 7am before knocking it on the head before bedtime. In footage this year, chimps appeared to bond over fermented African breadfruit.\nChimps are not the only ones. A review of evidence published last year found alcohol consumption to be commonplace in the animal kingdom. And looks can be deceiving: slow lorises, known for being wide-eyed fur balls, will down the strongest alcoholic drinks they can get their hands on.\nAlthough chimps devour impressive quantities of fermented fruit, working through about 4.5kg a day, they show no obvious signs of inebriation. According to Maro, to feel the full effects of alcohol, the apes would need to eat enough fruit to make them bloated.",

        "content": "Irish police investigating the fate of a boy who disappeared four years ago but was only registered by authorities as missing last month have found the remains of a child on Dublin wasteland.\nGardaí named the missing boy as Daniel Aruebose, who is thought to have vanished in 2022 aged three, after they discovered the remains on Wednesday in the Donabate area of north Dublin.\nOfficers secured the scene pending examinations by a pathologist and forensic anthropologist. Police believe the body is that of Daniel but formal identification must await DNA analysis.\nSpecialist teams and a cadaver dog began the search on 1 September after authorities became aware that the child was missing.\nThe case has put renewed scrutiny on child welfare services after it emerged Daniel had been missing for four years without authorities knowing. Another child, Kyran Durnin, disappeared in 2022 but was not noticed by authorities until August last year.\nThe alarm was first raised over Daniel in late August when the department of social protection alerted Ireland’s child and family agency, Tusla, to irregularities in an application for child support payments. Tusla alerted the police, who made house-to-house inquiries at the Gallery apartment complex in Dublin where Daniel had previously lived, before launching what turned into a 17-day search of open ground.\nPolice urged anyone with relevant information to come forward and appealed to the public to beware “speculation, rumours and theories” about what happened to Daniel. “An Garda Síochána appeals to all members of the public to independently verify any information that you are reading on social media and/or messaging apps,” said a statement.\nThe children’s minister, Norma Foley, said the death of a child was always heartbreaking and upsetting. “But it is especially so for those who knew and loved this child. I extend my very sincere sympathy to all involved.”\nTusla confirmed earlier this month it had been in contact with Daniel and his parents in 2020. The agency arranged foster care for the boy but his parents then decided to keep him, leading to Tusla closing the case.\nThe case has been referred to the independent National Review Panel for investigation and the government has instructed Tusla to undertake “wellbeing checks” on other cases closed during the pandemic.\nThe case shares eerie parallels with that of Kyran Durnin, who was last seen in May 2022 when he was six and a pupil at a primary school in Dundalk, County Louth, but whose disappearance was only confirmed last year. If still alive he would be nine. Police took the unusual step of opening a murder investigation even though no body has been found.",

        "content": "Much about Tuesday night in Fort Lauderdale was typical. The weather was sticky and humid. The crowd at Chase Stadium was lively. And on the field, Lionel Messi assisted Jordi Alba, and vice-versa, in a 3-1 win for Inter Miami. That the victory came against the Seattle Sounders, the side that beat Miami in a contentious Leagues Cup final two weeks ago, gave the squad a measure of revenge. But there are bigger factors at play.\n“It was important to regain positive feelings,” Miami head coach Javier Mascherano told reporters afterward.\nIndeed, between the Seattle game and a subsequent loss to Charlotte FC, Miami had not just suffered two consecutive shutout losses, but they were depleted due to injuries and suspensions (Luis Suárez due to his antics in the Leagues Cup final and Tomas Avilés for a red card against Charlotte). Inter Miami only had six players on the bench on Tuesday; two were 18-year-old academy products and another was 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti, who just arrived from Newell’s Old Boys.\nDespite this, Miami’s win pushed them to fifth in the Eastern Conference on 49 points – eight behind the leaders, Philadelphia Union. With three games in hand, Inter Miami still have a chance at repeating last season’s achievement: finishing at the top of the East and winning the MLS Supporters’ Shield, given to the club with the best regular-season record.\nThe ultimate goal, though, is altogether different: win MLS Cup.\nThe league championship has been the most coveted objective for the Herons. There is an argument that winning the Concacaf Champions Cup is perhaps more prestigious due to its continental scale, or that the Shield is the trophy that most resembles league titles in most other competitions worldwide. But MLS Cup is the trophy that matters to the most important people: the fans. From Atlanta United’s tremendous victory in 2018 with Miguel Almirón and Josef Martínez to Carlos Vela, Gareth Bale and the Mexican-American euphoria with LAFC in 2022, and even going back to DC United’s inaugural victory in 1996, winning MLS Cup is an achievement that permeates across a club’s community and history.\nNaturally, every MLS team wants that title. The difference with Inter Miami is that the stakes are so much higher simply because they have Messi. With 46 trophies to his name, no one in the game has more silverware, and the pressure for him to win MLS Cup is less on him and more on the club as a whole to deliver a championship to add to that list.\nBecause of his arrival and everything that has occurred since, Inter Miami are one of the biggest marketing attractions in the league, second in value to LAFC, per Forbes. According to research firm SponsorUnited, subscriptions to MLS’s Season Pass broadcast package on Apple TV more than doubled since Messi came to the league, and sponsorship revenue jumped 13% last year to $665m. Other clubs have also benefited. Sporting Kansas City, for example, hosted Inter Miami at the Kansas City Chiefs’ Arrowhead Stadium in 2024, drawing a club record crowd of 72,610. In addition, Inter Miami’s new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, is set to open next year and there is hope that Messi will still be around to lead them into their new home.\n“I previously said that my wish, my dream would be for the No 10 to inaugurate our new stadium in March,” Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas told ESPN this summer. “This is a decision that rests on Messi. We wish for Messi to finish his career here.”\nYet at the time of writing, there has been no official word regarding the extension. The prospect of opening the stadium as MLS Cup champions will no doubt be enticing to Messi, though. He faced a similar dynamic after finally capturing the 2022 World Cup, when he could have retired from the national team at 34 years old but chose to continue playing with his country so he could do so as a world champion.\nInter Miami have achieved much in the Messi era, including a points record in a Supporters’ Shield season in 2024 and a run to the round of 16 in the Club World Cup, which featured a 2-1 victory over FC Porto, making them the first Concacaf team to beat a Uefa side in official competition.\nMLS Cup, though, is an entirely different type of competition – the capstone to playoffs that are a season unto themselves, where results from the regular season don’t mean much aside from determining the matchups. Miami know this as well as anyone, having lost in the first round last year in one of the most shocking upsets in league history.\nThis time around, Mascherano will know that Messi, now 38, is close to the end of his career. The need to win with Inter Miami is becoming urgent. And some things will need to improve.\nTo maximize their chances of success, Miami must deliver a more consistent tone, both in the playing of the game and the mentality with which they approach it. Suárez’s conduct in the Leagues Cup final doesn’t help things, and he’s not the only one who has had disciplinary issues. Out of 30 clubs, Inter Miami are ninth in the disciplinary standings but with far fewer matches played. Mascherano manages as he used to play – aggressively – and that can be both a strength and a weakness.\nThere’s little doubt that Inter Miami will make the playoffs, and there’s also a chance that the club can top the East again as their remaining matches – aside from Nashville SC on the final day of the season – are against teams in lower positions.\nBut that’s not the goal. The Philadelphia Union, FC Cincinnati, Charlotte FC and Florida rivals Orlando City are among the teams standing in Miami’s way in the East playoffs. All except Philly have beaten the Herons this season, and all are capable of doing so again (and that’s before getting into a potential final matchup against high-flying San Diego FC, Son Heung-min’s LAFC, the tactically clever Minnesota United, history-making Vancouver Whitecaps, a rematch against the Seattle Sounders, or whoever else comes out of the West).\nThe road to MLS Cup is realistic and achievable for Inter Miami, but it comes with numerous obstacles.",

        "title": "Scottish parliament scraps legal verdict of ‘not proven’",
        "content": "The Scottish verdict of “not proven” – a global legal anomaly thought to be a key factor in the country’s significantly lower convictions rate for rape and sexual assault – has been abolished.\nMSPs agreed to scrap the unique Scottish verdict as they voted through a series of major changes that Angela Constance, the justice secretary, said “put victims and witnesses at the heart of a modern and fair justice system”.\nThe abolition of not proven – a third option for juries that dated back to the 18th century and which acquitted an accused person but stopped short of finding them not guilty – was welcomed by the campaigner known only as Miss M as “giving survivors and their families back their voice”.\nMiss M launched her campaign against the verdict in the Guardian in 2018 after winning a landmark civil action when the criminal case against the man she accused of raping her on a university freshers’ week night out was found not proven.\nShe said: “We have all spoken up about how damaging this verdict is. Today we have been listened to and the improvements to the legal system are going to make it fairer and clearer going forward.”\nIn 2022-23, the not proven verdict made up 61% of rape and attempted rape acquittals, compared with an overall rate of 22% for all criminal offences. She added: “To know that another rape victim isn’t going to experience what I had to go through after my criminal trial ended is the very reason I’ve invested so much time and energy into this campaign.”\nThe final vote on the Scottish government’s victims, witnesses and justice reform bill passed by 71 votes to 46 after a lengthy debate considering more than 160 amendments.\nConstance told MSPs on Wednesday afternoon it was “time to come together” to support the bill, which also changes the jury process to require a two-thirds majority for conviction, establishes a specialist sexual offences court, and enshrines in Scots law the right to lifelong anonymity for rape complainers (the Scottish legal term for complainants).\nShe said: “By changing culture, process and practice across the system, it will help to ensure victims are heard, supported, protected and treated with compassion, while the rights of the accused will continue to be safeguarded.”\nThe bill will also establish a victims and witnesses commissioner and provide an automatic right to publicly funded, independent legal representation for complainers to oppose applications asking questions about their previous sexual history.\nBut Liam Kerr, the shadow justice secretary, told the Holyrood chamber the bill “misses so many chances to do better”. He said the Scottish Conservatives voted against the “half-baked” final bill after their amendment to establish an inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland fell, as did their “no body, no release” proposal to require the parole board to consider whether killers have provided information on the whereabouts of their victims’ remains.\nThe chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, commended the “many positive steps” in the new law but reiterated “serious concerns” about the increase to the jury majority. “Research shows a reluctance to convict rape cases and deep-rooted prejudices around sexual violence affect public attitudes and jury decision-making every day. An increased jury majority will undoubtedly make survivors’ fight for justice even harder.”",

        "title": "Google DeepMind claims ‘historic’ AI breakthrough in problem solving",
        "content": "Google DeepMind claims it has made a “historic” artificial intelligence breakthrough akin to the Deep Blue computer defeating Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997 and an AI beating a human Go champion in 2016.\nA version of the company’s Gemini 2.5 AI model solved a complex real-world problem that stumped human computer programmers to become the first AI model to win a gold medal at an international programming competition held earlier this month in Azerbaijan.\nIn a performance that the tech company called a “profound leap in abstract problem-solving”, it took less than half an hour to work out how to weigh up an infinite number of possibilities in order to send a liquid through a network of ducts to a set of interconnected reservoirs. The goal was to distribute it as quickly as possible.\nNone of the human teams, including the top performers from universities in Russia, China and Japan, got it right.\nIt failed two of the 12 tasks it was set, but its overall performance ranked it in second place out of 139 of the world’s strongest college-level computer programmers. Google said it was a “historic moment, towards AGI [artificial general intelligence]”, which is widely considered human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n“For me it’s a moment that is equivalent to Deep Blue for Chess and AlphaGo for Go,” said Quoc Le, Google DeepMind’s vice-president. “Even bigger, it is reasoning more towards the real world, not just a constrained environment [like Chess and Go] … Because of that I think this advance has the potential to transform many scientific and engineering disciplines.” He cited drug and chip design.\nThe model is a general purpose AI but was specially trained to solve very hard coding, maths and reasoning problems. It performed “as well as a top 20 coder in the world”, Google said.\n“Solving complex tasks at these competitions requires deep abstract reasoning, creativity, the ability to synthesise novel solutions to problems never seen before and a genuine spark of ingenuity,” the company said.\nSpeaking before the details were made public, Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, said the “claims of epochal significance seem overblown”. He said AI systems had been doing well on programming tasks for a while and the Deep Blue chess breakthrough had “essentially no impact on the real world of applied AI”.\nHowever, he said “to get an ICPC question right, the code actually has to work correctly (at least on a finite number of test cases), so this performance may show progress towards making AI-based coding systems sufficiently accurate for producing high-quality code”.\nHe added: “The pressure on AI companies to keep claiming breakthroughs is enormous”.\nMichael Wooldridge, Ashall professor of the foundations of artificial intelligence at the University of Oxford, said it sounded like an impressive achievement and “being able to solve problems at this level is exciting”. But he questioned how much computing power was needed. Google declined to say, apart from confirming it was more than available to an average subscriber to its $250-a-month Google AI Ultra service using the lightweight version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think in the Gemini App.\nDr Bill Poucher, executive director of the ICPC, said: “Gemini successfully joining this arena, and achieving gold-level results, marks a key moment in defining the AI tools and academic standards needed for the next generation.”\nFour machine intelligence breakthroughs\n1957 The Perceptron\nFrank Rosenblatt, an academic at Cornell University,worked out that it should be possible to create a “perceiving and recognising automaton”. He named it the Perceptron and said an electronic system would be able to learn to recognised patterns in optical, electrical or tonal information “in a manner which may be closely analogous to the perceptual process of a biological brain”. The following year he built the device, which was the size of a small room. It was considered one of the early breakthroughs in artificial intelligence based on neural networks.\n1997 Big Blue\nIn May 1997, IBM’s Big Blue became the first computer system to defeat a reigning world chess champion in a match under standard tournament controls. It beat Garry Kasparov in what became an inflection point in computing power, but the contest was close. Kasparov won the first game, Deep Blue the second followed by three draws. Deep Blue won game 6 to secure the win. It showed how brute force computing power could create a system to defeat a human, albeit at a narrow task. “The computer is far stronger than anybody expected,” said Kasparov, conceding defeat.\n2016 AlphaGo\nGo is one of the most complex games ever devised, and one of the world’s master players was Lee Sedol, a South Korean professional. In 2016, DeepMind, the UK AI company set up by Demis Hassabis, took him on with its computer AlphaGo. It won 4-1 and some of its moves seemed to display truly original thinking. Move 37 in particular went down in lore. Hassibis said: “It might be the first glimpse of a bright and bold future where humanity harnesses AI as a powerful new tool, helping us discover new knowledge that can solve some of our most pressing scientific problems.”\n2020 AlphaFold\nAnother breakthrough by Hassibis and DeepMind was an AI program that can predict how proteins fold into 3D shapes, a highly complex process fundamental to understanding life’s biological machinery. The Royal Society, the 360-year old London scientific institution, called it “a stunning advance”.",

        "title": "Obama says Trump deepened US divide in rush to ‘identify enemy’ after Charlie Kirk shooting",
        "content": "Barack Obama addressed the recent killing of Charlie Kirk and told a crowd in Pennsylvania on Tuesday the country was “at an inflection point”, but that political violence “is not new” and “has happened at certain periods” in US history.\nObama added that despite history, political violence was “anathema to what it means to be a democratic country”.\nThe former president made the remarks at the Jefferson Educational Society, a non-profit in Erie, Pennsylvania. He explicitly denounced political violence, addressing the fatal attacks this year of Kirk and the Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman. He called both incidents “a tragedy” and said Donald Trump had further divided the country rather than work to bring people together.\n“There are no ifs, ands or buts about it: the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,” he said.\nObama warned that the response to Kirk’s assassination last week, which has kicked off a debate about free speech and the incitement to violence, could serve to deepen political and cultural divisions.\n“There’s been some confusion, I think, around this lately, and, frankly, coming from the White House and some of the other positions of authority that suggest, even before we had determined who the perpetrator of this evil act was, that somehow we’re going to identify an enemy,” he said.\nPoliticians on the right, including Trump, have blamed the “radical left” for fostering a dangerous political environment. Many on the left say those claims are a pretext for an authoritarian crackdown on free speech.\nObama has kept something of a low profile in his post-presidency. Responding to a moderator’s questions on Tuesday, he addressed Trump’s rhetoric after Kirk’s assassination, as well as other administrative moves.\nHe spoke about his own leadership following the 2015 killings of nine Black parishioners at a Charleston, South Carolina church, as well as George W Bush’s decisions following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He said the role of a president in a crisis was “to constantly remind us of the ties that bind us together”.\nThe sentiment among Trump and his aides following Kirk’s killing of calling political opponents “vermin, enemies … speaks to a broader problem”, Obama said.\nKirk, a dominant figure in conservative politics, became a confidant of Trump after founding Turning Point USA, one of the nation’s largest political organizations. Trump has escalated threats to crack down on what he describes as the “radical left” following Kirk’s killing, stirring fears his Republican administration is trying to harness outrage to suppress political opposition.\nThe White House responded to Obama’s remarks by blaming him for animosity in the country, calling him “the architect of modern political division in America”.\n“Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other, and following his presidency more Americans felt Obama divided the country than felt he united it,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, in a statement.\nIn the aftermath of Kirk’s killing, political leaders including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, Joe Biden and George Bush called for an end to political violence and a return to reasonable debate to lower the political temperature in the US.\nObama sought to hold a middle ground in his remarks, praising Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox, who he said showed “that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate”.\nThe desire to identify an enemy, Obama indicated, was misplaced. “We’re going to suggest that somehow that enemy was at fault, and we are then going to use that as a rationale for trying to silence discussion around who we are as a country and what direction we should go,” Obama said. “And that’s a mistake as well.”\nWhile he believed that Kirk’s ideas “were wrong”, Obama said that “doesn’t negate the fact that what happened was a tragedy and that I mourn for him and his family”. Denouncing political violence and mourning its victims “doesn’t mean we can’t have a debate about the ideas” that Kirk promoted, he added.\n“Those are all topics that we have to be able to discuss honestly and forthrightly, while we still insist that in that process of debate, we respect other people’s right to say things that we profoundly disagree with,” Obama said. “That’s how we should approach this.”\nObama on Tuesday also referenced Trump’s recent deployment of national guard troops in Washington and ID checks by federal agents in Los Angeles. He urged citizens and elected officials to closely monitor the norm-busting decisions.\n“What you’re seeing, I think, is the sense that through executive power, many of the guardrails and norms that I thought I had to abide by as president of the United States, that George Bush thought he had to abide by as president of the United States, that suddenly those no longer apply,” Obama said. “And that makes this a dangerous moment.”",

        "title": "RFK Jr’s actions risk restricting children’s access to vaccines, say ousted CDC officials",
        "content": "Top former officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) accused Robert F Kennedy Jr of hobbling the country’s ability to respond to outbreaks and disease threats.\nThe two officials testified at a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) committee. Susan Monarez, the CDC director chosen by Kennedy, was fired after less than a month. Debra Houry, chief medical officer at the CDC, resigned after serving under six CDC directors during both Republican and Democratic administrations.\nOn the morning of 25 August, Kennedy demanded that Monarez “commit in advance to approving every ACIP recommendation, regardless of the scientific evidence”, she testified. He also directed her to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy without cause, she said.\n“He said if I was unwilling to do both, I should resign. I responded that I could not pre-approve recommendations without reviewing the evidence, and I had no basis to fire scientific experts,” Monarez believes that’s the true reason she was fired, she said.\nKennedy was “very upset” and “tense” in their meeting. He spoke of the CDC and its employees in a “hurtful and disparaging” manner, Monarez said.\n“He called, in that context, CDC the most corrupt federal agency in the world. He emphasized that CDC employees were horrible people,” she said. “He said that CDC employees were killing children, and they don’t care.”\nMonarez went on to say that based on what she observed during her tenure, “there is a real risk that recommendations could be made restricting access to vaccines for children and others in need, without rigorous scientific review. With no permanent CDC director in place, those recommendations could be adopted.”\nShe continued: “The stakes are not theoretical. We already have seen the largest measles outbreak in more than 30 years, which claimed the lives of two children. If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return.”\nAlso on 25 August, Monarez said Kennedy told her “the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing starting in September, and I needed to be on board with it”. She said Kennedy had the support of the Trump White House, with Kennedy claiming to her that “he spoke to the President every day about changing the childhood vaccine schedule”.\nThe CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, ACIP, which has been replaced with Kennedy’s handpicked advisers, will meet on Thursday and Friday. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana who chairs the committee, recently called for an indefinite postponement of the ACIP meeting.\n“If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,” Cassidy, who is a physician, said on 28 August.\nACIP will reportedly take up a vote on the current recommendation that the hepatitis B vaccine be given at birth.\n“Folks know I’m a physician – as it turns out I am a hepatologist, which is a liver specialist,” Cassidy said. “I have seen people die from hepatitis.”\nMore than 90% of children infected at birth develop chronic, lifelong infections and risk liver cancer, he said.\n“Now that we’ve controlled it, do we let the genie out of the bottle if the recommendation goes away?” Cassidy asked.\nDebra Houry also testified to seeing political interference and said she “resigned because CDC leaders were reduced to rubber stamps, supporting policies not based in science, and putting American lives at risk.” She said Kennedy “censored CDC science, politicized its processes and stripped leaders of independence.”\nApproximately 80% of center directors are now acting because career officials have been fired, resigned or retired, Houry said.\nThese unprecedented changes come as the CDC and its employees face violence and threats. On 8 August, a shooter unloaded more than 500 rounds on the CDC headquarters, with 180 bullets hitting the building. Houry said her staff was “traumatized”.\nKennedy did not call Monarez following the shooting, Monarez testified. Such violence following decades of misinformation and harassment of scientific officials has sweeping repercussions. Some CDC staff will now not put their names on scientific reports on vaccines to protect themselves and their families.\nHoury first learned that Kennedy had changed the CDC’s Covid vaccine guidance in a Twitter/X post.\n“CDC scientists have still not seen the scientific data or justification for this change,” she said.\nHoury testified that she has never briefed the secretary, nor have her center directors – even as the worst measles outbreak in decades unfolded. She also pushed back on misinformation from the secretary: “He said things like vaccines had fetal parts, and I had to send a note to our leadership team to correct that misinformation. We were also asked to include things like budesonide and clarithromycin in our toolkits for physicians, and I couldn’t allow that, as there wasn’t evidence for that and would result in harm.”\nThe new restrictions on Covid vaccines have led to chaos and confusion with the updated vaccine rollout, though Kennedy testified before the finance committee on 4 September that “anybody can get the booster.”\n“My mom lives in Virginia, and she was unable to get it,” Houry said.\nThe HHS also interfered with information about thimerosal (also known as thiomersal), a preservative demonstrated to be safe, and allowed an “unvetted presentation” on thimerosal to occur in the June ACIP meeting, she said.\n“That kind of last-minute alteration undermines confidence and the deliberations that follow,” Houry said.\nThe vaccine advisers ultimately voted to ban thimerosal, which is used in about 4% of flu vaccines in the US. If vaccine-preventable diseases are allowed to continue rising, “it’s going to be heartbreaking,” Houry said.\nHoury added that she’s “concerned about the future of CDC and public health in our country.\n“We are not prepared, not just for pandemics, but for preventing chronic health disease, and we’re going to see kids dying of vaccine-preventable diseases,” she continued.\nKennedy said in the finance committee hearing a few weeks ago that Monarez told him she was untrustworthy. Monarez then said in Wednesday’s hearing: “He told me he could not trust me because I had shared information related to our conversation beyond his staff. I told him, if you cannot trust me, then you can fire me.”\nThe issue under debate on Wednesday went beyond the circumstances of Monarez’s and Houry’s departure, said senator Bernie Sanders.\n“It is about Secretary Kennedy’s dangerous war on science, public health and the truth itself. It is absurd to have to say this in the year 2025, but vaccines are safe and effective.”",

        "title": "The Guardian view on Labour and the economy: the legacy was grim but voters need hope, not excuses",
        "content": "At the start of this month, Sir Keir Starmer initiated “phase two” of his government, with a view to turning its fortunes around. Then the deputy prime minister resigned over unpaid taxes. On the eve of a state visit by the US president, the ambassador to Washington was sacked over his friendship with a convicted paedophile, and this week a senior adviser to the prime minister resigned over offensive text messages.\nThose are just the personnel problems. The new phase is supposed to focus on policy delivery, but that is hard to achieve with a sluggish economy, sticky inflation and shrinking fiscal headroom.\nThis week it was reported that the Office for Budget Responsibility expects to downgrade its estimates of UK productivity in advance of the budget in December. The knock-on effect would be to narrow the chancellor’s capacity for funding public services. The shortfall could be up to £30bn. Much of that will have to come from tax rises. Rachel Reeves’s last attempt to plug a fiscal hole with spending cuts led to a raid on benefits that had to be largely aborted to quell a mass rebellion of Labour MPs.\nThe government still intends to find savings in that area. It is the unenviable job of Pat McFadden, the new work and pensions secretary, to find a way that doesn’t reignite backbench fury.\nEven if Ms Reeves succeeds in bringing restive Labour colleagues on board with her budget, she will face a ferocious onslaught from opposition parties and rightwing media for raising taxes. She will be accused of reneging on promises not to burden “working people” with higher levies, even if she adheres to the letter of the manifesto commitment not to hike income tax, national insurance, VAT and corporation tax.\nThe government will blame its economic predicament on the Tories. It is true that Sir Keir inherited a public realm in disrepair, and wafer-thin margins for fiscal manoeuvre are partly a legacy of Liz Truss incinerating British financial credibility. But they are also a function of choices made by Ms Reeves in opposition. Now, 14 months after the general election, the public wants more evidence of improvement, and fewer excuses.\nMost people accept that it takes time to fix something that was very broken, but they need confidence that there is a plan; that leaders have a national destination in mind and a route map to get there.\nFailure to articulate such a thing has badly damaged Sir Keir. It doesn’t account for the full collapse in his poll rating since the general election last year, but the absence of an optimistic message has been an aggravating factor whenever there have been other setbacks. It has accelerated the decline in mood among Labour MPs from anxiety to panic. There are mutterings about replacing the prime minister if things continue on the current trajectory.\nIt is not too late to stabilise the situation. A sustained absence of unforced errors and scandal would be a start. It would buy space in which to set out a credible offer of economic renewal, narrated with conviction as part of a wider story of national purpose. The ability to make such a case is a core competence in any prime minister.\nIf Sir Keir cannot demonstrate it soon, he should expect his party to advance from doubting his leadership to seeking an alternative.",

        "title": "Nick Clegg: US-UK tech deal is ‘sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley’",
        "content": "A multibillion-dollar transatlantic tech agreement announced to coincide with Donald Trump’s state visit represents “sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley”, Nick Clegg, Meta’s former president of global affairs, has said.\nThe former deputy prime minister said the deals, heralded with great fanfare by the government as it tries to foster growth in the UK, were “mutton dressed as lamb” and would make the country ever more reliant on US tech firms.\nThe announcements have included some of the biggest companies in the tech world, such as chipmaker Nvidia and the ChatGPT developer OpenAI. One announcement featured a Microsoft investment that was said to be worth $30bn (£22bn).\nHowever, speaking at a Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, Clegg said the relationship between the UK and the US tech sector was “all one-way traffic” and that the announcements suited the companies.\nHe warned Britain was being “defanged” by simply fostering a greater reliance on the US tech sector, rather than building its own.\n“These companies need those infrastructure resources anyway,” he said. “They’re building datacentres all over the world. Maybe they were pushed a bit forward just to meet the timetable with this week’s state visit. But … it’s all one-way traffic.\n“We’re a kind of vassal state technologically, we really are. The moment our companies, our tech companies, start developing any scale or ambition, they have to go to California, because we don’t have the growth capital here.”\nHe also revealed former US ambassador Peter Mandelson had asked for his advice on the tech sector before the Trump visit. Clegg said he advised the peer to be cautious about US-UK tech tie-ups.\n“In a sense, this US-UK tech deal is just another version of the United Kingdom holding on to Uncle Sam’s coat-tails,” he said.\n“We just have to be a little bit more realistic about our predicament and a little bit firmer about what we can do ourselves, rather than what I think we’re seeing with this US-UK tech deal – which is basically just taking sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley.”\nHis intervention will frustrate ministers, as attracting investment from big tech has formed a major part of their search for growth. The deals have been used as an example of Britain’s success in building a close US relationship.\nIt came after Jensen Huang, the co-founder and chief executive of the US AI chipmaker Nvidia, predicted “the UK is going to be an AI superpower” as he announced a new £500m investment in a British firm.\nHuang, who was due to join Donald Trump at Wednesday night’s state banquet with the king, said he was taking an equity stake in Nscale, a UK cloud computing company, and predicted it would earn revenues of up to £50bn over the next six years.\n“We’re here to announce that the UK is going to be an AI superpower,” he told a press conference in London.\nHuang cited as evidence of Britain’s potential its universities and several companies founded in the UK, ranging from the AI giant DeepMind to the driverless car startup Wayve.\n“You just don’t appreciate it. Your universities. Come on. You’re too humble,” he said.",

        "content": "The EU has called for closer ties with India while admitting there was no “mutual understanding” with Narendra Modi’s government over Russia’s war on Ukraine.\nThe EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, and lead negotiator on trade, Maroš Šefčovič, outlined an EU-India strategy on Wednesday as part of Europe’s drive to build and strengthen alliances in a world shaken by Donald Trump’s challenges to the postwar order.\nBut they did not attempt to hide differences with New Delhi, after Indian forces took part this week in Russia’s Zapad (western) military exercises in Belarus that simulated a war with Nato countries.\nKallas, who is from Estonia, one of the EU’s frontline states which is seen as vulnerable to a Russian attack, said: “This is a great concern for our countries. I mean if you want closer ties with us then why participate in exercises that are an existential threat to us?”\nShe said there were “clear areas of disagreement” that were obstacles to deeper cooperation, but Europe did not want to push India into “Russia’s corner”.\nCommenting on India’s purchases of Russian oil and military exercise participation, Kallas added: “We will definitely always raise these questions and currently we don’t have a mutual understanding here.”\nThe European Commission also objects to India’s purchases of discounted Russian oil, which helps Vladimir Putin fund his war on Ukraine.\nMeanwhile the EU is grappling with demands from Trump to impose up to 100% tariffs on India and China, another buyer of Russian oil, to pressure Russia to end the war.\nThe EU has said it intends to tighten secondary sanctions on non-European actors that are helping Russia evade western restrictions when it publishes its next set of sanctions proposals.\nBut privately, officials have balked at 100% tariffs, at a time when Brussels is also trying to sign a trade agreement with India by the end of the year.\nŠefčovič did not respond directly to questions about whether the EU would agree to US demands for 100% tariffs, but said the bloc already had strong measures aimed at stopping circumvention of sanctions.\nHe added: “We are of course coordinating very closely with the United States, but also with other G7 partners because we believe if the G7 acts in the same manner, of course, the impact, then it is much stronger.”\nAsked about the link between the trade talks and India’s relations with Russia, Kallas said: “Negotiations are negotiations and until we agree about everything then nothing is agreed.” She added that the EU had to take into account its interests, concerns and “problematic issues”.\nThe strategy paper was published shortly before the Kremlin announced Putin had had a phone call with Modi, where they discussed plans for the Russian president’s visit to India in December.\nŠefčovič, who is in charge of trade talks, said trade between the EU and India had grown by 90% over the last decade, making the bloc India’s largest trading partner, ahead of the US and China, as well as one of India’s top investors – “and yet I am absolutely convinced that we have only scratched the surface”.\nBut he was also downbeat about the latest round of trade talks, saying he had hoped to see more progress in meetings last week.\n“What we need is a commercially meaningful, fair agreement and I need the understanding of my Indian counterparts, [that] it must be fair and balanced,” he said, pointing out that any agreement would have to be approved by EU member states and the European parliament.\nThe commission is racing to strike trade deals around the world since Trump hit many European goods with tariffs and pressured the EU into an unequal trade agreement.\nBut in a sign of Europe’s difficulties in finalising trade deals, the approval of a recent agreement with four South American countries in the Mercosur bloc remains in doubt, amid opposition from France and Poland.\nMeanwhile the Polish energy minister, Miłosz Motyka, has called on the EU to end Russian oil imports by the end of 2026 “to cease financing Russia’s war machine” and help end the war in Ukraine.\nIn a letter seen by the Guardian, Motyka argued that “the current international circumstances, combined with the need to strengthen the resilience of European economies, require a common response”.\nHe said that a commitment to the 2026 deadline would “establish a clear timeline, and demonstrate our resolve to achieve independence from oil supplies burdened with political and strategic risks”.\nPoland also called for “coordinated … compensatory mechanisms” to help with “a fair and orderly transition” for countries most affected, which would also include measures on “safeguarding access to alternative oil sources in the event of disruptions”.",

        "title": "The Guardian view on Christianity and the UK far right: churches must stand up to the false prophets of division",
        "content": "England’s established church has now been leaderless for going on 10 months, following Justin Welby’s resignation as archbishop of Canterbury. The Crown Nominations Commission is finally expected to vote on a successor in the coming weeks. Whoever that turns out to be will face familiar and thorny problems, from disagreement over safeguarding structures to the Anglican church’s seemingly unending arguments over sexuality.\nAfter last weekend’s “unite the kingdom” march in London, a new challenge should be added to the list. Christian nationalism is already a force in the United States, and has played a defining role in European culture wars in countries such as Poland and Hungary. At last Saturday’s rally the striking proliferation of wooden crosses and flags bearing Christian slogans suggest an ominous and rising influence on the British far right. From the speakers’ platform in Whitehall, crowds were led in chants of “Christ is King” and participated in public prayer recitals, while being urged to defend “God, faith, family, homeland”.\nThe secular co-opting of Christian identity to incite racial intolerance and Islamophobia has a track record on these shores. In 2009, the archbishops Rowan Williams and John Sentamu publicly admonished the British National party for using the language of faith “to foster fear”. But it used to be a relatively fringe pursuit. The rise of Reform, and the embedding of the far right within a broader revolt against mainstream politics, suggests that we are in new territory.\nAs anti-migrant sentiment in Britain is both normalised and radicalised, figures such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, are successfully adopting the Viktor Orbán playbook, casting themselves as defenders of a Christian country under existential threat from outsiders. The crosses, Bible verses and prayers on display at the rally – like the Saint George’s flags appearing in streets across the country – placed a patina of false piety on a nativist message brimming with hostility towards the multicultural reality of modern Britain.\nIn academic literature, the use of Christianity as a cultural dividing line has been aptly characterised as “Christianism” – an aggressive and exclusionary assertion of “belonging” that need not have any connection with actual religious belief. Battered and bruised though the Church of England may be after Mr Welby’s unhappy departure, it must explore ways to assert itself against such perversions of the gospel message of inclusion and compassion for the stranger.\nOne key to that may lie at grassroots level, where church and interfaith groups are often at the heart of initiatives aimed at enhancing social cohesion and wellbeing. In a statement issued prior to last Saturday’s march, the Bishop of Edmonton observed that “every day, in our churches and on our streets, we see a very different city to the one that the marchers portray”. By embodying an ecumenical sense of neighbourliness, local churches can help counter the far right’s pseudo-Christian posturing.\nChurch leaders have a duty to do the same on the national stage. Inveighing against the Trump administration’s policy of mass deportations in February, the late Pope Francis was withering in his condemnation of ethno-nationalism dressed up in a cassock and carrying a cross. In an ever more febrile public square, the next archbishop of Canterbury will also need to be loud and clear in their defence of basic Christian principles.",

        "title": "‘A sense of self and self-worth’: Deborah Willis on the importance of Black photography",
        "content": "When Dr Deborah Willis was an undergrad student at the Philadelphia College of Art, she asked the question that informed her work for years to follow: “Where are all the Black photographers?”\nFrom photos by Gordon Parks in Time magazine to Black image-makers capturing daily life in Ebony and Jet magazines – she knew that Black photographers, like her father, were making their impact on the world. Growing up, her father was an amateur photographer, and her father’s cousin owned a photo studio, and seeing them photograph people as a child created a desire in her to become an image-maker.\nAt seven years old, she discovered the book The Sweet Flypaper of Life by Langston Hughes and Roy DeCarava; upon seeing its cover image, she had a revolution. “Fast forward, I wanted to be a photographer,” she says.\nUltimately, her passion for photography would result in pioneering research for her in-depth undergrad paper, which included about 300 names and works by Black photographers. Publisher Richard Newman would recognize the importance of her findings, and together in 2000 they would create Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers: 1840 to the Present – the first comprehensive history of Black photographers.\nTheir book reshaped the narrative of America through showcasing to the nation images that centered the point of view and life of the everyday Black person in the moments in which they were facing discrimination and subjected to subhuman treatment.\nOn 18 November, a new edition of the book will be released; in coordination she has curated an exhibit titled Reflections in Black: A Reframing on view in New York City. Willis is now a professor and chair of the photography and imaging department at New York University and its Center for Black Visual Culture Institute for African American Affairs. She has also published many other books and held several teaching positions and, in a full circle moment, she was curator of photographs and prints at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture which served as her guiding light as she did her undergrad research.\nShe hopes Reflections in Black allows people to rethink their stereotypes of Blackness. “I want people to see that this work that the artists are making is about freedom, freedom to express that voice that James Baldwin always talked about,” she says. “Freedom to think of progress and to see the new narratives that are not based on others who only see Black people as othered and demeaning … and see it as an intervention.”\nThroughout the book, she guides the audience through pivotal moments that informed the image-making process of Black photographers. First, daguerreotypes invented by Louis Daguerre were the first successful photographic process introduced to the public in 1839. This new image-making technique that shaped photography from 1840 to 1900 allowed Black photographers such as James P Ball, Glenalvin Goodridge, and Augustus Washington t​​o make portraits of the everyday African American.\nFrom 1900 to 1940, Black photographers started to have their own studios, allowing photography to become more accessible during a time in which Black people were facing segregation and discrimination.\n“One need only peruse the visual representations of Black people commonly produced on postcards and sheet music to realize that the exaggerated features and demeaning situations depicted there left an enduring negative impact, one that has endured to this day,” Willis writes in Reflections in Black. “Most of their African American clients wanted to celebrate their achievements and establish a counter-image that conveyed a sense of self and self-­worth.”\nFrom 1930 to 1940, Black photographers such as Gordon Parks, Vera Jackson, and Arthur Eddie Williamson began working as photojournalists for local newspapers and magazines, such as Our World, Ebony, Sepia and Flash, which were marketed to Black readers. Their photographs became a more comprehensive coverage of political events and protests, with the help of smaller handheld cameras in the 1930s.\nBlack image-makers in the 1950s to 1960s, such as Doug Harris, Elaine Tomlin, and Bobo Fletcher, began to study photography in workshops, art schools, and community centers. “Many of these photographers were determined to awaken social consciousness,” Willis notes in the first edition of Reflections in Black. “Their work is a testimony to the depth of understanding and love these photographers have for humanity.”\nFrom the 1980s to the 1990s, work by photographers such as Coreen Simpson began to be viewed as fine art, combining graphic abstraction and conceptual photography. Many of these images were “informed by their families and explored how they dealt with social issues like racism, unemployment, and child and sexual abuse”, Willis writes. Photographers ask their viewers to “contextualize his or her own experience within the visual referents offered by the photographer, and in doing so to find her or his own historical perspective, interpretation, or meaning in these works”, Willis writes.\nCurrently, she is intrigued by photographers who are asking difficult questions about their personal and family lives while creating abstract photographs and using colors to photograph their environment. “Photographers are documenting, but they’re also making and asking questions about the future,” she says. “At the same time, they’re finding ways to celebrate the lives that have been lived and using new technologies to make three-dimensional images, making them monumental.”\nThe Black New Vanguard, a term coined by Antwaun Sargen, a writer, editor and curator, recognizes the current decision by photographers like Tyler Mitchell and Adama Delphine Fawundu to move photography forward by adding film-making, memory studies and historical references to their process. Willis says in this movement, “you just find pleasure, you just find passion, and so I see that in some other ways that the new vanguard, that they are looking at ways to find pleasure and joy in their experiences, as they experience the difficult moments”.\nAs the photographers adapted and changed their style, for Willis the concept of beauty has an everlasting presence in the work of Black image-makers. She began to notice the presence of everyday beauty in her mother’s salon growing up. “I learned beauty matters for women of all ages and all disciplines,” she says. But her experiences in 2001, transformed how she defined beauty. That year was a “shocking, awful, and surprising experience”, as she describes it.\nAfter winning the MacArthur award that year, her 27-year-old nephew was killed during an altercation at a nightclub in Philadelphia when he was on his way to help her install an art exhibit she curated in DC. The first thing she said to herself upon hearing about his death was, “These kids did not know love. How could you not know love? How could they not see his beauty? How could that happen?”\nMonths later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and as a result she began to lose her hair, and noticed how uncomfortable people became with her bald head and lack of eyebrows. “Even in illness, beauty is important, because people would say some horrible things, and be insensitive to the fact that I’m dealing with my mortality,” she notes.\n“I thought about Toni Morrison and her work, and she said, ‘Beauty is,’ and then just those two words meant so much to me,” she says. “I started thinking about images from the 19th century, how Black women who were enslaved, how they began to adorn themselves, and why it was important for them to see themselves as human.”\nIn the new edition of Reflections in Black, she continues her mission by not portraying beauty as a performance, but by illuminating the quiet everyday moments of Black life that are full of hope, struggle, resilience and joy\n“I’m hoping people will see that [Black] people are not performing” Willis says. “[and] that we are human.”",

Enough is enough. It must end now. And in every case, each of us has a responsibility to condemn and reject political violence wherever it rears its head.”\nThe Minnesota election came amid heightened alarm in the US over political violence, and comes just days after the far-right activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University.\nAuthorities say that the man accused of killing the Hortmans, 58-year-old Vance Boelter, had a list of targets which included Democratic lawmakers and abortion rights advocates, and that he traveled to two other legislators’ homes that evening – with plans to assassinate them.\nIn an interview with the Associated Press over the weekend, Bittner said that she noticed early in her campaign that residents in the area where Hortman was killed seemed afraid to open their doors.\n“We are in very, very scary times, and we definitely need to get out of this trajectory that we’re on here,” Bittner said.\nBittner said that the rise in political violence briefly made her question running for office, but that she ultimately decided: “We can’t cower.”\n“We have to move forward as a country,” she added. “We have to embrace the system that we have of representative government, and we have to just do it, you know? …There’s no way to solve this problem if we shrink back in fear.”\nLee told the Minnesota Star Tribune in August that one of his motivations for running was to “take up” Hortman’s “legacy of leadership” and said that Hortman “paved pathways for a lot of us”.\nLee told the AP that Hortman was a neighbor he often saw walking her dog, and that she had offered him guidance when he ran for city council.\n“I can’t think of a better way to honor her than to go to the capitol and do my best in the seat,” Lee said.\nLee acknowledged the heightened tensions following Kirk’s killing, describing the current political climate as a “charged atmosphere”.\n“So I want to do what I can to really bring that down,” he said, including supporting a ban on automatic and semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.\nLee said that he keeps a shotgun himself for home defense but that assault-style rifles “are weapons of war that really we don’t need on our streets”.\nBoelter faces federal and state murder charges in the Hortmans’ deaths, as well as attempted murder and other charges in the shooting of another Democratic Minnesota lawmaker, state senator John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, who both survived.",

        "content": "The killing of Charlie Kirk last week sent shock waves through America among both supporters and opponents of his views. Yet until last week, the young rightwing activist was relatively unheard of – by older generations anyway – outside the US.\nAs the ripples and implications of his death continue to spread across the US and beyond, our big story takes a step back. Washington bureau chief David Smith explains how the young activist rose to prominence and gained a place within Donald Trump’s inner circle, his provocative brand of populism and charisma playing an outsize role in the Republicans’ 2024 election victory. As Steve Bannon, the prominent rightwing commentator, told the Guardian, Kirk’s popularity with young voters “changed the ground game” for Trump and the Maga movement.\nKirk’s shooting also returned the focus to the vexed issue of gun control in the US. Ed Pilkington examines whether a country where weapons violence has become normalised is prepared to ask searching questions of itself. And commentator Jonathan Freedland gives a pessimistic prognosis that a “country born in violence” shows even less inclination under Trump than it may have done in previous administrations to heal the division that is pulling American society apart.\nThank you for subscribing to the Guardian Weekly – and if you’re a new reader, welcome!

        "title": "The Thin Duck: Heston Blumenthal’s new menu for diners on weight-loss jabs",
        "content": "When gazing at the bill after a Michelin-starred meal, the average diner’s first thought is not usually: “I wish I’d got less food for that.”\nBut Heston Blumenthal has come up with a new menu catering to just that sentiment, tailored to reflect a growing demand for smaller portions, driven by weight-loss drugs.\nThe restaurateur and TV chef says his alternative selection of tasting courses at the Fat Duck will provide the same flavour and theatre for less-hungry guests – including those taking appetite-suppressing drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro – but in reduced quantities.\nWhen booking at the world-famous restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, diners can choose the Mindful Experience, which offers all the same creations as the usual menu, the Journey. These include the Nitro-Poached Aperitif, a frozen cocktail puff made with liquid nitrogen, and the Crab and Passionfruit 99′, which reimagines a seaside ice-cream cone.\nHowever, portion sizes are reduced by about 20%-30% per dish, and in some cases by up to 50%, while the price is £75 a head cheaper at £275.\nThe offering reflects a rush to accommodate changing tastes as other GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda become more common in the UK as treatments for obesity.\nBlumenthal has himself been prescribed Mounjaro to help manage weight gained as a side-effect of his medication for type 1 bipolar disorder. “What struck me was the feeling of not being hungry,” he tells the Guardian.\n“I still wanted to eat, but I didn’t feel that drive. It made me think – this is going to kill the restaurant industry, because if people aren’t eating as much, restaurants won’t be as enticing. I’m not sure what will happen to supermarkets either.\n“I don’t think this change is bad for health. It could actually be very good for people. But it will affect alcohol, wine, food consumption, even supermarkets. I’ve even heard airlines could save money on fuel. This is only going to escalate in the next couple of months, and already millions of people are on these drugs.”\nAccording to the industry publication Food Manufacture, 37% of UK consumers now cite weight loss as their top health priority. Research presented at a UKHospitality seminar earlier this year showed that 7% of UK adults, about 3.6 million people, used these drugs.\nBusinesses whose models have been upended include Weight Watchers, which has emerged from bankruptcy protection in the US after amassing more than $1.4bn (£1bn) of debt and is now recommending GLP-1 jabs alongside its usual lifestyle-change advice.\nThe wider food industry is also bracing for change, though the effects could be gradual. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that the consumption of fizzy soft drinks, baked goods and salty snacks in the US could fall by up to 3% by 2035.\nHowever, some in the industry have said they do not anticipate a big impact on sales as take-up of the drugs could remain relatively low. Other food manufacturers are already making changes: Nestlé, for instance, is developing higher-protein and nutrient-dense products to meet the needs of consumers eating less overall.\nThe consumer champion Martin Newman says: “We’re already seeing other hospitality businesses pivot. In the US, brands like Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Panera have expanded lighter, protein-rich menu ranges designed for people eating less … Here in the UK, restaurant groups are widening ‘lighter choice’ menus, and delivery platforms like Deliveroo are making calories and protein far more visible.\n“Weight-loss drugs are no longer niche … It’s a lifestyle change and not a fad. Therefore, eating out must adapt.”\nNewman says some operators may worry about “spend per head going down” with smaller portions, but that “misses the bigger picture”. He added: “If you can align eating out with people’s health goals, you’ll increase frequency and protect loyalty.”\nBlumenthal, who has built a career on innovation and exploration of the science of food, says his new menu reflects these shifts. “Millions of people are eating much less food, drinking less, losing interest in restaurants, losing interest even in food,” the chef says. “For more than a decade I’ve been saying that mindful eating is one of the keys to happiness and mental health.”\nBlumenthal adds that mindful eating can be applied beyond fine dining, even to simple meals. But in the case of the Fat Duck, the new menu is designed specifically to meet shifting appetites. “Sometimes, less really is more.”\nTrish Caddy, of the analysts Mintel, argues that while weight-loss drugs are beginning to affect dining out in the UK, their impact remains limited. “These drugs are expensive and highly regulated, restricting their use typically to wealthier consumers. Heston Blumenthal’s smaller-portion menu seems tailored to this group, highlighting a shift toward health-conscious dining rather than a mass-market change.”\nThe Fat Duck says the price of both menus reflects the labour-intensive nature of service at the restaurant, which operates with almost as many chefs and waiters as guests during a sitting.\nThe restaurant is celebrating its 30th anniversary, three decades after opening on 16 August 1995. Originally a brasserie, it soon became famous for its experimental molecular gastronomy, producing dishes such as snail porridge and nitro-scrambled bacon-and-egg ice-cream. The restaurant rose rapidly through the Michelin ranks, gaining three stars by 2004, and in the following year was named the world’s best restaurant, the only British venue to ever take the top spot.",

        "content": "Key events\nShow key events only\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\nThat’s your lot. I’ll leave you with Taha Hashim’s report. Bye!\nShare\nThe player of the match is Phil Salt\nI enjoyed that. It was a pretty good wicket and it’s a good ground to bat on when you get going. Yeah. good fun.\n[On his partnership with Jos Buttler] That’s the way we play I suppose. We both try to take it on really early, and when it works it looks good.\n[On missing out on a century] Ah, potentially. But I don’t want to start thinking like that – we won the first game of the series and I’m happy with that.\nShare\nJacob Bethell's verdict\nIt feels pretty special [to captain England], and to win the first one is always nice. Great feeling and I can’t want to get going again on Friday.\nComing off the field we probably thought Ireland had got a few too many, but the conditions here were a bit of an unknown. Now, going into Friday and Sunday. we know how to defend and take wickets at this place.\n[On Salt and Buttler] I think their average opening partnership is about 55 with a ridiculous strike rate, so for me personally batting after them is pretty nice! We’ve also got a lot of depth which means everyone can go really hard.\nI said to a couple of the guys, there’s aren’t many sports where you get the two extremes: ou get the proper big stadiums and then you get to bring it back home almost to a ground like this. It’s a lovely ground and I’ve heard Friday and Sunday are sold out so hopefully the atmosphere will be even better.\nShare\nPaul Stirling’s reaction\nThere were multiple positives to take and hopefully across the three games we can improve. We were pretty happy with 196 – but we also knew we had to get everything right in the field, and we didn’t quite manage that.\nWe kept trying to take wickets. That’s all you can do in cricket these days – there’s no point being ultra-defensive.\nWe’ve got a big winter ahead of us and this is the start of that.\nShare\nThe matchwinner – stop me if you think etc – was Phil Salt, who pannelled89 from 46 balls to take England to the brink of victory. His last two T20 innings have yielded 230 runs for one dismissal from 106 balls, with 25 fours, 12 sixes and umpteen statgasms.\nShare\nEngland win by four wickets with 14 balls remaining!\n17th over: England 197-6 (Jacks 1, Overton 4) Overton hustles a full toss from McCarthy down the ground for four to complete a comfortable win for England in Jacob Bethell’s first game as captain.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.54 BST\n17th over: England 191-6 (Jacks 0, Overton 0) That was the last ball of the over. The margin of victory/defeat will flatter Ireland a touch; equally, they’ve done well to take it this deep because at one stage they were disappearing for a boundary a ball.\nShare\nWICKET! England 191-6 (Banton c Campher b Humphreys 11)\nWHATEVER HAPPENED TO RED-INK CULTURE? Tom Banton reverses Humphreys for a couple of boundaries before blasting straight to mid-on. He could have milked a single and got a nice not out.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.42 BST\n16th over: England 181-5 (Salt 89, Curran 15) Hume’s figures now look a bit healthier: 2-0-36-2. Still bonkers, but nowhere near as grisly as they were after two balls of the over.\nShare\nWICKET! England 181-5 (Salt c Adair b Hume 89)\nNo century for Phil Salt! It’s almost a shock to type that given how comfortable he looked. But he chased a very wide, very full ball from Hume and sliced it straight to Adair at deep backward point. Salt whacks his bat angrily on the way off; his standards are so high these days that 89 isn’t good enough.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.58 BST\nWICKET! England 180-4 (Curran c Dockrell b Hume 27)\nPoor Graham Hume is having a day to forget. His first over was Buttlered for 22; now Sam Curran has hit him for successive sixes at the start of the second. They’re two superb shots, pulled over square leg and lasered over extra cover, and as I type Hume is nursing figures of 1.2-0-35-0. It’s nothing personal, just Baziness.\nHume eventually catches a break when Curran, aiming for his third straight six, picks out Dockrell on the midwicket boundary.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.39 BST\n15th over: England 167-3 (Salt 89, Curran 15) Curran deposits Humphreys over long-on for his first six, which means all 10 players who have had a bat today have hit at least one six. But only one has a chance of making a century; Salt is now 11 away with 30 runs needed for victory.\nShare\n14th over: England 154-3 (Salt 84, Curran 6) Salt biffs McCarthy to deep extra cover and races back for the second. The umpire checks for the run-out but it’s a precautionary measure; Salt was comfortably home.\nMcCarthy is about to bowl to Salt when the wind blows one of the bails off; he jokingly raises the finger to give Salt out.\nSalt smiles and whacks the next ball for four. He’s 15 away from a century.\nShare\n13th over: England 147-3 (Salt 78, Curran 6) Glenn Maxwell and Rohit Sharma have a record five T20I centirues from 114 and 151 innings respectively. This is Salt’s 43rd T20I innings, and he didn’t score his first hundred until the 18th. What he’s doing is barely legal.\nIt’d be funny if, after all this premature statgasming, England went on to lose the game. They need 50 from 42 balls.\nShare\n12th over: England 141-3 (Salt 76, Curran 2) Salt is denied another boundary, this time off Young, by a spectacular diving stop from Campher at cow corner. The upshot is one of the few boundaryless overs of the day.\n“Afternoon Rob,” writes Kimberley Thonger. “Can you pull any strings and please get a message sent out from the England dressing room for them to slow the scoring rate a bit? My daughter-in-law is in labour and I need to be distracted from that as long as possible. It’s not much to ask is it? They’ll have polished this total off before she’s even started pushing properly if something isn’t said.”\nCongratulations! I’ll try to telepathise this to Phil Salt.\nShare\n11th over: England 137-3 (Salt 73, Curran 1) Salt deposits a long hop into the crowd to move to 73 from 31 balls. The fella needs help, he can’t stop committing acts of violence against a cricket ball.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.28 BST\nWICKET! England 130-3 (Rehan b Delany 8)\nThe legspinner Gareth Delany, playing his 100th white-ball international for Ireland, comes tantalisingly close to taking a wicket with his first ball.\nRehan sliced him towards short third, where Hume swooped forward to grab the ball very close to the ground. Hume shook his head, unconvinced it was a clean catch. The umpires went upstairs anyway; the replays were inconclusive and Rehan was given not out.\nNot that it made much difference, even in the short term. Two balls later Rehan charged Delany, missed a sinew-straining smear and was bowled by a ball that kept a bit low. A nice moment for Delany on his landmark day.\nShare\n10th over: England 130-2 (Salt 67, Rehan 8) Rehan Ahmed pulls Curtis Campher’s second ball flat and hard for six. A single turns the strike over to Salt, who blisters another short ball to cow corner for four. He needs 33 for another century. Even if he doesn’t achieve it, his T20 record is just silly.\nShare\n9th over: England 117-2 (Salt 61, Rehan 1) Rehan Ahmed is the new batter. This is the first time he’s batted higher than No8 for England in white-ball cricket, though he looks increasingly comfortable up the order for Leicestershire and Trent Rockets.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.01 BST\nWICKET! England 116-2 (Bethell c Adair b Tector 24)\nSix and out for Jacob Bethell. He hit 14 from three balls, culminating in a huge slog-swept six that necessitated a ball replacement, then sliced Tector straight to extra cover.\nSo much for rotating the strike! But Bethell’s cameo of 24 from 16 balls has moved England closer to a crushing victory.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.18 BST\n8th over: England 102-1 (Salt 61, Bethell 10) Bethell is giving the strike to Salt at every opportunity, an obvious tactic but one that not all 21-year-old captains would care for on their big day.\nSalt carts Young to cow corner for four, just wide of the diving Campher near the boundary, then smears another past the bowler to bring up the hundred in 7.3 overs. Salt has a chance of another century himself; it would be his fifth, equalling the record of Glenn Maxwell and Rohit Sharma.\nEngland need 95 from 72 balls. Don’t we all.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.54 BST\n7th over: England 91-1 (Salt 52, Bethell 8) That cock-up aside it’s a good first over from Tector, who is only an occasional offspinner. No boundaries, seven from it.\nShare\nSalt caught off a no-ball\nSalt slugs a high full toss from the offspinner Harry Tector to deep midwicket – but it’s a front-foot no-ball! Oh, Harry.\nShare\nSalt races to 20-ball fifty\n6th over: England 84-1 (Salt 50, Bethell 5) Salt moves to a 20-ball fifty with a cut for four off McCarthy. Just another day at the T20 office for him. If he’s still in after 10 overs he’ll be eyeing his fifth T20I century.\nSalt might be England’s Heinrich Klaasen – not in style or role, but the man whose numbers blow the mind of neutrals around the world. At the time of typing, he has a T20I average of 38 and a strike rate of 171. What even is that?\n“It must be so dispiriting to post a solid total and then in the space of 20 balls be staring down the barrel of a now near run-a-ball chase,” says Eddy Nason. “These two opening is a cheat code.”\nEngland may have to change their plans for the World Cup, which involved Ben Duckett opening, possibly Jamie Smith too. I guess Buttler will drop down to No3 but it must be tempting to keep cheating.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.48 BST\n5th over: England 74-1 (Salt 45, Bethell 0) In statistical terms Salt and Buttler are the most devastating partnership in T20I history: 1145 runs at an average of 52 and a run-rate of 10.71.\nBoth the average and the run-rate are the highest among pairs who have added at least 1000 runs.\nShare\nWICKET! England 74-1 (Buttler c Campher b Buttler 28)\nUsually on the OBO we try to provide at least a basic description of every boundary. You can sing for that today! Salt smashes Humphreys for four and six – but now Buttler has gone, caught at mid-on after being done in the flight by Humphreys. Nicely bowled.\nButtler made 28 from 10 balls, and now it’s time for England’s new captain to have a bat.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.56 BST\n4th over: England 63-0 (Salt 34, Buttler 28) Craig Young is the latest bowler to trry his luck. Salt lashes his first two balls for four, because in 2025 this is normal behaviour, apparently, but Young does well to stall England for the rest of the over.\nNow, who would like a statgasm? Since the start of the T20 against South Africa on Friday, Salt and Buttler have added 189 in 11.5 overs.\nShare\nButtler smashes 24 off the third over\n3rd over: England 52-0 (Salt 24, Buttler 27) Jos Buttler has been in awesome form of late, the cricketing embodiment of his famous mantra, and he has just belted Graham Hume’s first over for 24.\nWhere to start? With the almost absent-minded swipe over mid-on for four, I guess. That was followed by an elegantly violent drive over long-off for six and a cuff through the coivers. Hume beat him with a slower ball; Buttler waved the next over mid-off before ending the over with a devastating straight hit for four. Sheesh.\nOh, that brought up the fifty partnership inside three overs.\nShare\n2nd over: England 30-0 (Salt 24, Buttler 5) Salt picks a slower ball from Barry McCarthy and desecrates it down the ground for six. He follows that with a brusque slap through extra cover and a brusque smear over midwicket for six more. The ball hit the rope on the half-volley.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.31 BST\n1st over: England 11-0 (Salt 7, Buttler 4) Phil Salt makes a desperately slow start, taking THREE deliveries to hit his first boundary. Jos Buttler then cuts the last ball of the over, his first, sweetly for four more.\nShare\nPhil Salt and Jos Buttler, fresh from pulverising South Africa, walk out to begin the England runchase. Ireland will open up with the left-arm spinner Matthew Humphreys.\nShare\nEngland need 197 to win\n20th over: Ireland 196-3 (Tector 61, Dockrell 6) George Dockrell strolls to the middle, picks Jamie Overton up over square leg for six and walks off. Nice work if you can get it, and do it.\nAdil Rashid is interviewed on his way off. He says Ireland “played exceptionally well” on a slowish pitch but that England are confident of chasing 197.\nShare\nUpdated at 14.55 BST\nWICKET! Ireland 190-3 (Tucker c Buttler b Overton 55)\nTucker brings up a hard-hitting fifty by launching Overton for six over long off. He falls next ball, top-edging a sharp bumper through to Buttler. Lovely innings from Tucker: 55 from 36 balls with four sixes.\nIreland have one delivery remaining.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.05 BST\n19th over: Ireland 181-2 (Tector 59, Tucker 48) Tucker clumps Curran for a straight six, the start of a damaging over for England. Tector picks up successive boundaries in the other V, the one behind the batsmen, and Curran ends with 4-0-43-0. Ireland still have an outside chance of reaching 200.\nShare\nFifty for Tector\n18th over: Ireland 163-2 (Tector 50, Tucker 40) Harry Tector is such a good player. He plonks Adil Rashid emphatically over midwicket for six, his second and Ireland’s ninth, then pushes two down the ground to reach a stylish fifty from 31 balls.\nRashid finishes with figures of 4-0-36-1.\nShare",

        "content": "Nationwide building society has defended its chair, Kevin Parry, after he became the first boss of a major British lender to publicly engage with Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party.\nIt emerged on Wednesday that Parry, who has been chair of the member-owned building society since 2016, attended a breakfast event earlier this week meant to help companies understand Reform’s approach to business.\nThe breakfast event was hosted by Sanctuary Counsel, a consultancy focused on “building, enhancing and protecting” the reputation of clients, with Parry seated next to Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice.\nIt makes Parry the first senior boss from a UK bank or lender to be publicly seen with the party, which has outlined controversial policies including the mass deportation of asylum seekers, ripping up green energy contracts and stripping the City watchdog of its power to regulate the banking industry.\nThe building society, which is owned by its 17 million members, defended Parry’s attendance – which was first reported by the Financial Times – saying it was part of “routine” engagement with parties across the political spectrum.\nA Nationwide spokesperson said: “As part of his role, our chairman meets with representatives from across the political spectrum. These engagements are routine and reflect our commitment to constructive dialogue on issues that matter to our members and the wider sector.”\nBusiness leaders have been closely watching Reform after its sweeping local election victories this year and as opinion polls suggest it could win hundreds of seats at a general election. But while Reform said it had welcomed hundreds of businesses to its annal conference in Birmingham earlier this month, most groups sent junior staff, with bosses still concerned about being associated with the rightwing party.\nAll of the UK’s “big five” trade bodies – including the CBI, British Chambers of Commerce and Federation of Small Businesses – dispatched public affairs executives to the conference.\nHeathrow sponsored an airport-style lounge for business delegates and First Group provided double-decker buses for meetings. JCB, the digger-maker owned by Lord Bamford, the billionaire former Conservative donor who is now backing Reform, was also an exhibitor, and other corporate attenders included Airbnb and Japan Tobacco International.\nTikTok sponsored a drinks reception where Reform councillors and the party’s newest MP, Sarah Pochin, rubbed shoulders with corporate lobbyists over complimentary canapés, pints and cocktails.\nHowever, companies are also treating the party with caution. One corporate affairs boss, who stayed away from the Reform conference, told the Guardian at the time: “Everyone feels awkward, no one wants to be called out as being there.”",

        "content": "The former chief US economics data statistics who Donald Trump fired last month called her sudden removal “dangerous” and said Americans should be concerned about the independence of key economic institutions.\n“Markets have to trust the data are not manipulated,” said Erika McEntarfer, the former head of the Bureau Labor of Statistics, in her first remarks since her firing. “Firing your chief statisticians for releasing data you do not like, it has serious economic consequences.”\nThe bureau collects and releases key economic data on the labor market and prices. In August, the bureau revised down initial figures that showed steady job growth in May and June by 258,000. Hours after the release, Trump fired McEntarfer, claiming without evidence that the “jobs numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”.\nIt was the first time a president had fired the head of the data bureau, and it left many economists shaken by what the future of the nonpartisan bureau could look like. Trump has since nominated EJ Antoni, chief economist at the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation and a co-author of Project 2025, in addition to a vocal critic of BLS, as McEntarfer’s replacement.\nAntoni has not yet been confirmed by Congress. William Wiatrowski, a longtime official within the bureau, is currently serving as acting commissioner.\nMcEntarfer, speaking at Bard College, said that although she trusts Wiatrowski, she is concerned about the future of the bureau.\n“Firing your chief statisticians for releasing data you do not like has serious economic consequences,” she said, noting that the collection of countries that have gone down a similar route, including Argentina, Greece and Turkey, is “not a good list”.\n“The resulting loss of trust in economics statistics led these countries to worsening economic crises, higher inflation and higher borrowing costs,” McEntarfer said.\nEven before her firing, McEntarfer said she was prepared to lead the bureau toward modernizing its data collection. But the bureau’s funding dried up, particularly once Trump entered office. Under cuts from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, the bureau’s staff fell 20% since January after hiring freezes and delayed onboarding.\nMcEntarfer said that, once Musk left the White House, she was hoping that the bureau could “return to some sense of normalcy”.\nBut when July’s jobs report was published, McEntarfer said a journalist reached out to her for comment about Trump’s social media post that said he was firing McEntarfer. At first, she didn’t take it seriously, but then she soon got a short email from the White House announcing her termination.\n“I can vouch for the accuracy and independence of the work of the agency up until the moment I was fired,” McEntarfer said, in light of Trump’s accusations. The data was revised downward after businesses responded to the survey late, likely “because they’re just too busy trying to stay alive”.\nHer firing suddenly made her a household name. She recalled the days when she had to be “careful not to bore family and friends by talking too much about my wonky job”.\n“Now all of a sudden, the whole world was talking about it,” McEntarfer said. “You should get to live in a country where you do not know who the chief statistician is.”\nShe said the bureau is facing “an uncertain moment” and said that Americans should broadly be concerned about the future of key economic institutions, including the Federal Reserve, which has also received heavy attacks from the White House.\n“Messing with economic data is like messing with the traffic lights and turning the sensors off. Cars don’t know where to go, traffic backs up at intersections,” she said. “Nobody thinks it’s going to be good for the country if we start messing with those traffic lights.”",

        "content": "Peter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, has said that he was not disturbed by the Tommy Robinson march on Saturday (Trump has fanned the flames of divisive politics around the world, says Sadiq Khan, 16 September). Well I certainly was. The levels of threatening hate and violence should be a wake-up call, not just for government ministers but for all of us. Stand Up to Racism has done its best to mobilise people to tackle this threat, but it’s clear that we have to find a new way forward to reinforce this work. I am urging people in all civil society organisations to start talking about the situation and in each sector to start talking to each other.\nI believe there is a fairly widespread understanding of the causes of the views and activities that the far right are exploiting. After Saturday, perhaps there is now a greater understanding of the urgency of the situation. Leading bodies and individuals in each sector of our society should take the initiative in convening urgent discussions of the role they can play in bringing our community together.\nAs the discussions develop, we will see what ideas different sectors of civil society have about what organisational form will be best to reinforce the work of Stand Up to Racism. It may be a series of coalitions that network and reinforce each other’s interventions.\nDifferent groups and sectors will have very specific contributions to make and will have their own views on what national networking they would be most comfortable with. I can only stress the dangerous urgency of the current situation.\nJohn McDonnell MP\nIndependent, Hayes and Harlington\nI was at the counter-protest at the weekend. I saw first-hand who the crowd attending the far right protest was made up of. It was not people who had boiling-over anger or who were expressing legitimate concerns about immigration. It was pure, gleeful racism. Drunk, laughing and jeering, then belligerent and violent, hurling verbal abuse, smoke grenades and the occasional Nazi salute at anyone who dared stand up to them – no matter that we were outnumbered 20 to one.\nAnyone who went to that event wanting to express legitimate concerns about immigration should not be surprised to be labelled a racist when keeping company with racists and listening to racist speeches from known racists. Luckily, 100,000 is still only 0.14% of the population. So, everyone else – it’s up to us to firmly say that whatever else happens, we will not legitimise bullying, bigotry and fascism on our streets.\nName and address supplied\nI understand and agree with Diane Abbott (What I saw at Saturday’s rally was racism, pure and simple. Labour won’t tackle it until we can call it what it is, 14 September), and would even say that racism is probably beyond “bubbling up”. Day to day, I am subject to overt and unashamed racism in casual conversation and see people I know and have counted as friends expressing open support for, and sharing content by extreme racists.\nEarlier this year I had to deal with the school after my mixed-race daughter was racially abused in class – repeatedly called an “illegal immigrant” and asked “if you cut yourself, will curry come out?”.\nThe time has come for our leaders to call this out, show some backbone and meet the moment.\nName and address supplied\nDiane Abbott is right to warn of the dangers in ignoring racism at events like Tommy Robinson’s rally. But we also need to rebuild the community spaces where people can meet, talk and find common ground. The loss of libraries, youth clubs, community centres and pubs has left many without places for face-to-face connection. In their absence, people turn to social media, where anger is amplified and exploited. Too often, the only remaining gathering points are closed, single-use spaces, whether faith buildings or private venues, which can deepen separation.",

The new toolkit runs to 80 pages and lists 314 standards over seven areas that institutions will be judged on. It’s like deciding to repaint the Titanic after it’s hit the iceberg.\nAnger is mounting about the opportunity being lost to create a humane and effective system of inspection. If the government accepts Ofsted’s gargantuan framework, the coming months will be consumed by conflict with the professionals.\nThere’s an alternative way forward. Ministers should set up a commission of teachers’ leaders, experienced inspectors and experts in inspection to produce a different model. It would support teachers to improve the quality of students’ learning, while dealing firmly, but sensitively, with the weaknesses that undeniably exist.\nWhy not test whatever model the government chooses by running alongside it a pilot of the best ideas on inspection, culled from national and international research? The pilot could take place in an area chosen to be as representative as possible of the country as a whole. Whatever system proved to be the more effective could become the makings of a new evidence-based approach.\nThe opportunity to enact reform comes round seldom. This one must be seized with both hands to end the decades of failure to raise standards. Will the government rise to the occasion and transform inspection for good? Over to you, Bridget Phillipson.\nFrank Coffield\nEmeritus professor of education, UCL Institute of Education\nWhen the secondary school that I led was first inspected by Ofsted in 1997 it involved 16 inspectors spending the best part of a week in school, going everywhere and seeing everything they needed to. The outcome report, though it pulled no punches, was thorough and largely accurate and provided a sound basis for our own development plan. Long before I retired, an inspection involved a mere four inspectors and lasted barely two days, with oral “feedback”, such as it was, being given after lunch on the second day.\nMartyn Oliver, the chief inspector, says Ofsted’s new traffic light report card will give parents the information they deserve and ensure that the work of education professionals is fairly assessed. The sad truth is that, like the one it replaces, this report will be done on the cheap and provide the very flimsiest of evidence on which parents or professionals could base any worthwhile judgments. Even worse, it will continue to be used punitively in judging headteachers and their staff and do nothing to relieve the unrealistic pressures, which see nearly a third of newly qualified teachers leave the profession within five years.\nChris Dunne\nLondon",

        "content": "Historic gold samples with a street value of €600,000 but priceless to scientists and researchers have been stolen from the French national natural history museum in the latest of a series of museum robberies in France.\n“This has happened in a critical context for cultural establishments in France, particularly museums,” the Paris museum said. “Several public collections have been the victims of robberies in the past months.”\nIn the early hours of Tuesday morning, an apparently well-planned criminal operation targeted the museum’s geology and mineralogy gallery. Cleaning staff detected the break-in later that day and museum teams saw that four to six pieces of gold were missing.\nThe thieves are believed to have used an angle grinder and blowtorch to force their way into the riverside museum that sits on the edge of Paris’s Jardin des Plantes. It is an unprecedented theft from the high-security museum.\nA museum spokesperson said thieves took “several specimens of native gold from the national collections held by the museum”. The spokesperson added: “While the stolen specimens are valued at around €600,000 based on the price of raw gold, they nevertheless carry an immeasurable heritage value. The museum laments this inestimable loss for research, heritage and for a collection accessible to the public.”\nNative gold is a metal alloy containing gold and silver in their natural, unrefined form.\nThe museum’s director, Emmanuel Skoulios, told BFMTV: “We are dealing with an extremely professional team, perfectly aware of where they needed to go, and with professional equipment. It is absolutely not by chance that they went for these specific items. Beyond the material value, for the museum this is above all about pieces in the national collection whose historic, scientific and heritage value is incalculable.”\nThe museum’s mineralogy gallery remained closed on Wednesday while the organised crime unit of Paris’s judicial police led an investigation. Security was increased at the museum and staff were checking the collection for other losses.\nOne of the museum’s treasures, according to its website, is a native gold and quartz sample measuring 9cm by 8.5cm that originated in the Donatia mine in California and was donated by a wealthy French collector.\nEarlier this month the Adrien-Dubouché National Museum in Limoges, central France, was broken into and thieves took three objects worth a total of more than €6.5m and classed as “national treasures” in France. They were two 14th- and 15th-century China porcelain plates and an 18th-century China porcelain vase.\nThe mayor of Limoges, Émile Roger Lombertie, told Agence France-Presse on the day the robbery was discovered: “Criminality is increasing, we always have to be one step ahead. All the great museums of the world have had pieces stolen at one time or another. It is seemingly collectors giving orders to established criminal gangs.”\nLast November, four men with axes and baseball bats smashed display cases in broad daylight at the Cognacq-Jay Museum in Paris targeting a popular exhibition, Pocket Luxury, which featured small precious objects from the 18th century. Seven valuable tobacco boxes were stolen, some of which had been on loan from the Louvre and the UK’s royal collection.\nThe next day, jewellery valued at several million euros was stolen in an armed robbery at around 4pm at the Hiéron Museum in Saône-et-Loire in central France.\nThe most notorious museum heist of recent times occurred at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris in May 2010. Vjeran Tomic, nicknamed Spider-Man, made off with masterpieces by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger and Amedeo Modigliani valued at more than €100m.\nThe case revealed extraordinary security lapses at the museum, including that motion-detection alarms had been out of order for two months, and three guards failed to spot Tomic, who in 2017 was sentenced to eight years in prison.\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report.",

They said the latest fatalities took the Palestinian death toll from the two-year war between Israel and Hamas past 65,000.\nThe Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has described the Gaza Strip as a “real estate bonanza” and said he is in talks with the US about dividing it up after the war, The Times of Israel reports. Speaking at a real estate conference in Tel Aviv, Smotrich said the destruction in Gaza is “the first stage in the city’s renewal”.\nThe Gaza health ministry said an Israeli drone had dropped grenades on one floor of the Rantissi children’s hospital on Wednesday. No casualties were reported but the ministry said 40 families took their children away, reports Reuters.\nSaudi Arabia on Wednesday condemned “in the strongest terms” the Israeli ground operation in Gaza City, a day after Israel unleashed a long-threatened ground assault on the territory. The kingdom also urged members of the UN security council to act to halt what it described as Israel’s killing, starvation and forced displacement of Palestinians, the foreign ministry said in a statement.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been in touch to share an update on the situation from Gaza via a Palestinian staff member in the territory. Writing on Wednesday, Ahmed Al Waheidi said those fleeing the north for the south face “congested, damaged and dangerous” roads, with journeys taking “hours”.\nA Catholic priest in Gaza city has vowed to stay in his church compound to help look after 450 people who have taken refugee there in the face of the ground assault launched by Israel. Carlos Ferrero told RTÉ they were “scared” and many of them felt that even if they did follow Israeli instructions and evacuate to the south of the City they were in peril.\nThe European Commission has proposed suspending some of the trade parts of the EU-Israel association agreement, 18 months after Ireland and Spain asked the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to review the agreement in light of the war in Gaza. Following her state of the union speech last week indicating a shift at the top of the EU, the commission’s presented a proposal today.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said that it had supported the medical evacuations of 10 “critical” children from Gaza to the UK. These children were evacuated with 50 companions, the WHO said. The PA news agency reports that the UK government said that it is working to make sure families receive “appropriate support” during their stay. More children are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.\nThe Israeli army said it has struck more than 150 targets in Gaza City since launching a major ground offensive on the Gaza Strip’s main urban hub early on Tuesday. “Over the past two days, the [Israeli air force] and artillery corps troops struck over 150 terror targets throughout Gaza City in support of the manoeuvring troops in the area,” the military said in a statement issued on Wednesday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nChina said on Wednesday it “firmly opposes” the escalation of military operations in Gaza after Israel launched a major ground assault on Gaza City. “China firmly opposes Israel’s escalation of military operations in Gaza and condemns all acts that harm civilians and violate international law,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said of the massive bombardment of Gaza City, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nPope Leo XVI expressed solidarity with the population of Gaza on Wednesday, saying that civilians had been “once again” forced from their land and were living in “unacceptable conditions”, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “I express my deep solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza who continue to live in fear and survive in unacceptable conditions, being forcibly displaced once again from their lands,” said the 70-year-old pope after his general audience.\nShare\nSmoke rises from an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza, as seen from the Israeli side of the border, southern Israel, earlier today.\nShare\nThe Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has described the Gaza Strip as a “real estate bonanza” and said he is in talks with the US about dividing it up after the war, The Times of Israel reports.\nSpeaking at a real estate conference in Tel Aviv, Smotrich said the destruction in Gaza is “the first stage in the city’s renewal,” adding:\nWe’ve already started negotiations with the Americans.\nThe comments echo past suggestions by US president Donald Trump to redevelop Gaza as a luxury coastal area.\nShare\nAt least 50 people were killed by Israeli strikes and gunfire across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including 39 in Gaza City, local health authorities said.\nThey said the latest fatalities took the Palestinian death toll from the two-year war between Israel and Hamas past 65,000.\nPalestinian officials and rescue workers say the true figure is likely to be higher as many people’s remains are trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings.\nShare\nLisa O’Carroll\nA Catholic priest in Gaza city has vowed to stay in his church compound to help look after 450 people who have taken refugee there in the face of the ground assault launched by Israel.\nCarlos Ferrero told RTÉ they were “scared” and many of them felt that even if they did follow Israeli instructions and evacuate to the south of the City they were in peril.\n“Some people, they say, ‘we don’t want to go. where are we going? There’s no safe place anywhere. That’s the truth,” he told RTÉ in an interview with News at One’s Rachel English.\n“Sometimes on the road there can be attacks. Sometimes you reach a place you don’t have a tent, you don’t know what to very bad situation, really, for everybody.”\nThe Holy Family Church compound in Gaza City has been bombed multiple times despite the IDF’s declaration it does not target religious sites.\nAmong those living in the compound are elderly people with dementia who do not understand what is going on, disabled children and sick people, Ferrero said.\n“We are all experiencing some concern and fear. Danger is there and on top of that the current situation, it adds a little more realism to the danger. People are scared. Everybody is scared, we are all scared,” he said.\nShare\nChildren ran to collect evacuation order leaflets dropped by Israel’s military on 17 September, asking people to move towards the south of the Gaza Strip.\nThe Israeli military said it was opening an additional route for 48 hours that Palestinians could use to leave Gaza City as it stepped up efforts to empty the city of civilians.\nShare\nUN warns on supplies for famine-stricken north Gaza after Israel shuts crossing\nThe United Nations voiced grave concerns on Wednesday about food and other supplies running out in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people were already experiencing famine, after Israel closed the only crossing there last week.\nIsrael began its long-expected ground assault on Gaza City in the north on Tuesday and is stepping up efforts to empty the city of civilians by opening an additional route southwards.\nHundreds of thousands of people are sheltering in the city and many are reluctant to follow Israel’s orders to move because of the dangers along the way, dire conditions, a lack of food in the southern area, and fear of permanent displacement.\n“There are grave concerns over fuel and food stock depletion in a matter of days as there are now no direct aid entry points into northern Gaza and resupply from south to north is increasingly challenging due to mounting road congestion and insecurity,” the UN humanitarian office (OCHA) said in a statement.\nThe Zikim Crossing was shut on 12 September and no aid groups have been able to import supplies since, it said.\nShare\nPalestinians flee toward southern Gaza along al-Rashid Street, carrying belongings on foot and in vehicles after intensified Israeli attacks and evacuation orders in the northern Gaza Strip.\nShare\nGaza health ministry accuse Israel of drone attack on children's hospital, report no casualties\nThe Gaza health ministry said an Israeli drone had dropped grenades on one floor of the Rantissi children’s hospital on Wednesday. No casualties were reported but the ministry said 40 families took their children away, reports Reuters.\nFikr Shalltoot, Gaza director at the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians said:\nThis hospital is the only specialist facility for children with cancer, kidney failure, and other life-threatening conditions – but even these gravely ill children are not spared from relentless bombardment.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.\nShare\nUpdated at 14.44 BST\nThe UK’s Green party leader Zack Polanski said he would be “standing up to the bully Donald Trump and his poodle, Nigel Farage” before joining protesters in London later on Wednesday. He also accused Trump of seeking to “whitewash his own complicity in the genocide unfolding in Gaza”.\nPolanski, who is in the lineup for a rally on Parliament Square organised by the Stop Trump Coalition, said:\nDonald Trump comes to Britain seeking credibility and to whitewash his own complicity in the genocide unfolding in Gaza.\nWhile the vast majority unite against Trump and everything he stands for, there will be one man who wants us to welcome him with open arms: Nigel Farage. Farage pretends to be a man of the people, but he’s really just a man of the super rich. Like Trump he seeks power, influence and money over all else.\nOur country has a proud tradition of standing up for the underdog. Today, that means standing alongside every child in Gaza; with all those in detention camps on the borders of the United States and with each and every one of those growing up in poverty here in Britain. And standing up to the bully Donald Trump and his poodle, Nigel Farage.\nShare\nSaudi Arabia on Wednesday condemned “in the strongest terms” the Israeli ground operation in Gaza City, a day after Israel unleashed a long-threatened ground assault on the territory.\nThe kingdom also urged members of the UN security council to act to halt what it described as Israel’s killing, starvation and forced displacement of Palestinians, the foreign ministry said in a statement,\nIsrael on Tuesday started a ground offensive to seize control of Gaza’s main urban centre. There has been a wave of criticism from countries around the region including Qatar, which has been hosting and mediating ceasefire talks.\nQatar described the Israeli ground offensive as a continuation of its “war of genocide” against the Palestinians.\nAfter a UN commission of inquiry concluded on Tuesday that Israel had committed\ngenocide in Gaza, Israel’s ambassador in Geneva, Daniel Meron, called the report “scandalous” and “fake”, saying it had been authored by “Hamas proxies”.\nShare\nLisa O’Carroll\nToday’s proposal by the European Commission to suspend trade parts of the EU Israeli association would not mean Israeli goods disappearing from European supermarkets, factories, or hospitals.\nIf adopted by the member states, who need to agree to it under qualified majority vote system (QMV), it would merely mean goods would no longer be duty free and subject to tariffs that apply to all non-EU countries that do not have a trade agreement with the bloc.\nThe EU is responsible for 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods with the world, selling some €16bn in 2024.\nIsraeli exports include everything from jet engines to pharmaceuticals including those from Teva. However, not all goods are exported under tariffs, as they are for example not imposed on pharmaceuticals under a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement.\nUnder the QMV system two conditions have to be met. 55% of member states need to back to the move. This means 15 out of 27 member states, but the bigger barrier is that the proposal must be supported by member states representing 65% of the total EU population.\nGermany represents 18% of the EU population, France 15% and Italy 11%.\nMaroš Šefčovič, the trade commissioner, admitted that the impact of the removal of free trade access, would be “modest”, as he told reporters that their suggestions that tariffs would amount to an additional cost of just €227m a year were “correct”.\nWhatever its economic consequences, it can be seen as a hugely symbolic move.\n“I would say the whole context of the decision was very political. … I think there was strong expectations that European Union have to use the tools at its disposal to address the humanitarian crisis,” he said.\nEU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, was also asked about whether she was confident about getting the suspension approved by the member states.\nShe said:\n“You know very well, how is the situation the council, although we see that … the public opinion in member states is really shifting because the suffering in Gaza and people really want to see [this stopped].\nI think we will have the discussions after these proposals are made, but I think the political lines are very much in the place where they have been so far.”\nShare\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been in touch to share an update on the situation from Gaza via a Palestinian staff member in the territory.\nWriting on Wednesday, Ahmed Al Waheidi said those fleeing the north for the south face “congested, damaged and dangerous” roads, with journeys taking “hours”.\nIn his update, he wrote:\nI left my wife and children in the north yesterday and travelled six hours to come and look for somewhere we could stay in Deir al-Balah. I want to call them every five minutes and check that they are OK or not – it is a constant fear knowing the hostilities are so close to them. The other day, a building was damaged within only fifty metres of them. The constant sound of explosions is terrifying for them, and they can feel the blast impacts – shaking walls and shock waves of dust – from hundreds of meters away. This is what it’s like every day for people. Many wake thinking the situation cannot get worse, but it continues to deteriorate.\nWhen I find somewhere, I will go back and get my family, but we don’t know yet how we will move our belongings down here. There are not enough trucks for people to use, and it’s too expensive for many people. Hundreds of families are losing their homes every day, and the vast majority cannot afford the cost of being displaced and moving to the south, so they are sleeping in the streets.\nMy wife’s nephew was severely injured recently, and we are his last remaining family. I don’t know how we will move him from the north down to here. My mind is overwhelmed with all the decisions we have to make and the lack of choices for any of them.\nThe roads are congested, damaged, and dangerous, with the few working vehicles in poor condition. Journeys take hours, often on foot, with no clear destination. Elderly or sick family members arrive exhausted in the south, where even here, many are left to sleep along the roads until they can find shelter.\nShare\nJakub Krupa\nTowards the end of the press conference, Kallas rejected suggestions that the EU has not done enough to put pressure on Israel and insisted the public opinion has shifted on this in recent months, as reflected by the proposed measures.\n“The proposals [are] now on the table to put more pressure on Israeli government … now it’s up to the member states to discuss [them] in the council, which is problematic, as we know of the lines.\nBut what it shows, really, it shows that the public opinion in all the member states has, has really shifted. And when we have the discussions, all the member states or representatives, foreign ministers, agree that the situation is untenable.\nSo if we all agree on this, then the question is, what do we do about this; what are the tools in our hands?\nAnd that’s why we have proposed, then from our commission, to go with these proposals. If these do not fly, then we can find other things, if we all agree that we need to do additional steps in order to have really change on the ground.”\nThis concludes the press conference.\nShare",

        "title": "Salt thrashes England past Ireland in first T20 as Bethell’s big day goes to plan",
        "content": "Jacob Bethell’s big day began awkwardly and ended with England dominant. After Ireland put up 196, some serious work was required as the 21-year-old became his country’s youngest men’s captain.\nEnter Phil Salt, ready to make headlines once again. The opener followed his 141 not out against South Africa last Friday with 89 off 46 balls as England secured victory in the first of three Twenty20 internationals with 14 balls to spare.\nIreland’s bowling effort could not live up to their strong display in the first half, when Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker combined for a third-wicket partnership of 123 off 11.2 overs, the former top-scoring with an unbeaten 61 off 36 balls.\nSalt, hammering with the pull shot, showed he can do it in the chase, too. Another rollicking opening stand with Jos Buttler – they amassed 74 inside five overs – made the remainder comfortable, a spurt of late wickets causing little bother.\n“Coming off at half-time it certainly wasn’t an easy target to chase,” said Salt. “[There was] a little bit there for guys taking pace off the ball, a little bit two-paced when they went hard into the wicket.” But he made it look a stroll, helping Bethell to a bit more history: this was England’s first win against Ireland in a men’s T20.\nMalahide was a lovely, leafy sight in the early afternoon, overnight rain making way for a poking sun. This was much needed for Ireland, short on fixtures at home because of a tight budget and with a three-match series against West Indies in June – their last assignment – including two washouts.\nPaul Stirling was grateful for the autumnal opportunity, putting on 57 for the first wicket alongside Ross Adair, no early release provided to Bethell. The hosts, up against the veteran pair of Liam Dawson and Adil Rashid, were keen to crush spin. Adair and Stirling found midwicket and long-on respectively as they tried to launch the tweakers, but Tucker and Tector remained on the hunt.\nTucker contributed a crucial 34 at No 3 in the previous T20 meeting between these two sides, a memorable Irish victory at the 2022 World Cup. Tector had the experience of being out in the middle five years ago, in his first one-day international series, when Ireland beat England in a pandemic bout at Southampton. The two twentysomethings had no reason to be fazed.\nTector pumped Rashid over the leg side, the fourth six conceded by the leg-spinner, and reached his half-century off 31 balls. There was further joy at the death; Ireland hit 45 off the last three overs, George Dockrell’s only-ball six providing the perfect finish.\nStill, Salt and Buttler were fresh from their pyro party last week, when they put up 126 inside eight overs. They immediately threatened to match that effort, taking just three overs to bring up 50; Buttler took 22 off one Graham Hume set, turning the 34-year-old’s medium pace into throwdowns.\nMatthew Humphreys’ left-arm spin forced a miscue from Buttler on 28 to bring in Bethell. Any nerves were understandable as the left-hander searched for the middle, his first 12 balls returning just 10. Salt appeared out to Tector’s part-time spin on 51 after finding a fielder, but a no-ball call kept the right-hander’s cruelty coming.\nBethell finally clicked with a series of boundaries off Tector, but fell in the same over with a chip to cover for 24. Rehan Ahmed emerged for his first England appearance of the year, granted an opportunity at No 4, but was a touch too eager when he charged Gareth Delany and was bowled for eight.\nSalt fell short of a fifth T20 international hundred – he would have joined Glenn Maxwell and Rohit Sharma at the top of the list – finding deep point off the expensive Hume at the end of the 16th over. But England, with 16 runs required, were in no position to fall from there.",

        "title": "LA police fired more than a thousand projectiles at protesters in a single day",
        "content": "Los Angeles police officers fired more than 1,000 projectiles at protesters on a single day in June as demonstrators pushed back against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and decision to deploy the national guard to the country’s second largest city.\nThe police department released a state-mandated report on Monday on use of force against protesters that included numbers on bean bags, rubber and foam rounds, and tear gas deployed during days of protests in Los Angeles.\nOn 6 June, police fired 34 rounds at about 100 people. On 8 June, police fired 1,040 projectiles at about 6,000 people, including 20 rounds of CS gas, a type of tear gas. Six injuries were reported as a result of those projectiles.\nThere were 584 police officers responding that day, the department said. Protesters had blocked off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire.\nThe report was concerning to Josh Parker, deputy director of policy at the New York University School of Law Policing Project.\n“The sense that I got from that data is that if that’s how you police a protest, then you’re policing it wrong,” Parker said.\nThe protests have put the use of these types of munitions by law enforcement under scrutiny. After journalists were shot, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order that blocked LA police from using rubber projectiles and other munitions against reporters.\nA protester who was hit and lost a finger filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city of LA and county sheriff’s department.\nCalifornia in 2021 restricted the use of less lethal munitions until alternatives to force have been tried to control a crowd. Police cannot aim “indiscriminately” into a crowd or at the head, neck or any other vital organs. They also cannot fire solely for a curfew violation, verbal threats toward officers, or not complying with directions given by law enforcement, such as when they order an unlawful assembly to disperse.\n“To see such a high number of projectiles discharged in a relatively short time period gives me grave concern that the law and those best practices were violated,” Parker said.\nA spokesperson for the Los Angeles police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. LAPD was planning a “comprehensive evaluation of each use-of-force incident”, said chief Jim McDonnell in a statement reported on 23 June by the Los Angeles Times.\nThe days of protests in “dangerous, fluid and ultimately violent conditions” left 52 officers with injuries that required medical treatment, McDonnell said. Officers were justified in their actions to prevent further harm, he said.\nTensions escalated in downtown Los Angeles on 8 June as national guard troops arrived to patrol federal buildings.\n“Agitators in the crowd vandalized buildings, threw rocks, broken pieces of concrete, Molotov cocktails, and other objects toward law enforcement officers,” the report said.\nMany protesters left by evening, but some formed a barricade of chairs on one street and threw objects at police on the other side. Others standing above the closed southbound 101 Freeway threw chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California highway patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the highway.\nPolice issued multiple unlawful assembly orders shutting down demonstrations in several blocks of downtown Los Angeles but the crowd remained and munitions were used to bring the situation under control, the report said.\nA box that read: “Other de-escalation techniques or other alternatives to force attempted,” was blank.\nParker said departments should plan for when a crowd begins throwing objects or being unruly, drawing on crowd management techniques.\n“It’s important that law enforcement agencies not needlessly provoke the crowd” with aggressive language or weapons on display, he said.\nLos Angeles sheriff’s deputies far outpaced the LAPD’s use of projectiles. With more than 80 deputies responding, the department deployed more than 2,500 projectiles on 8 June, the agency reported last week. It also said there were “hundreds to thousands” of people.\nThe California highway patrol, whose 153 officers responded to protesters blocking a major downtown freeway, estimated a crowd of about 2,000 people and used 271 rounds.\nThe tallies reported by LA police and deputies are high, especially considering the small number of deputies sent by the sheriff’s department, said retired LAPD Lt Jeff Wenninger, who provides expert testimony for court cases.\n“I don’t believe law enforcement officers or commanders truly understand the extent of this law, the restriction it provides,” he said. “And they just default back to old practices.”",

        "content": "Police investigating the rape of a British-born Sikh woman in a racially aggravated attack in the West Midlands have made a fresh appeal for public help as they bailed an arrested man.\nThe woman, in her 20s, reported being attacked by two white men while she was on her way to work in Oldbury on the morning of Tuesday 9 September.\nThe perpetrators allegedly told her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out,” as they attacked her between 8am and 8.30am, according to the Sikh Federation (UK).\nA man in his 30s, who was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of rape, has been released on bail pending further inquiries, West Midlands police said on Wednesday. Officers are continuing to appeal for information about the incident which police have described as “racially aggravated”.\nThe victim is being supported by officers, the force said, as they trawl hundreds of hours of CCTV and carried out “extensive” forensic inquiries. Detectives are urging anyone who saw two white men in the area to come forward. The first man is reported to have had a shaved head, a heavy build and was wearing gloves and a dark coloured sweatshirt, while the second was wearing a grey top with a silver zip.\nChief Superintendent Kim Madill, police commander at Sandwell, said: “We are working closely with key partners and we absolutely understand the concern of local people.\n“We need the public’s help to bring us information on who has carried out this horrendous attack. I can reassure you that we are doing everything possible to bring those responsible to justice on this young woman’s behalf.”\nA letter in the joint name of more than 450 UK Gurdwaras and Sikh organisations is being sent to Keir Starmer expressing disappointment at the lack of progress with the case.\nThe campaigners say there is an increased threat and, citing a number of recent high-profile racist attacks, call on Starmer “to encourage the new home secretary and new communities secretary to address anti-Sikh hate”.\nHundreds of people attended a vigil on Tuesday evening to support the woman. Salman Mirza, one of the organisers, told the Stourbridge News: “We feel there’s been a rise in racism and we want unity because we believe this is a good area. We’ve seen the hotel protests and there’s a lot of division at the moment and we want solidarity.\n“People are outraged and frightened at what’s happened to this woman – we wanted to get together and get women to speak. There’s a connection between the far right and misogyny.”\nThe woman has released a statement thanking the community for its “love and support”. She said: “I would never wish this on anyone. All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us.\n“Through it all, my family has been my rock and my community has stood strong beside me.”",

        "content": "Israel’s culture minister, Miki Zohar, has announced that funding for the Ophirs, the country’s national film awards, would be cancelled after The Sea, a film about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, won the best feature film prize.\nIn a statement on X, translated by Israeli news media, Zohar said: “There is no greater slap in the face of Israeli citizens than the embarrassing and detached annual Ophir awards ceremony. Starting with the 2026 budget, this pathetic ceremony will no longer be funded by taxpayers’ money. Under my watch, Israeli citizens will not pay from their pockets for a ceremony that spits in the faces of our heroic soldiers.”\nThe Sea, which automatically becomes Israel’s entry for the best international film Oscar, was written and directed by Shai Carmeli-Pollak. It stars Muhammad Gazawi as Khaled, a Palestinian boy who goes on a school trip to Tel Aviv to visit the beach for the first time but is denied entry at the border and embarks on a dangerous journey to sneak into the country. Gazawi, 13, won the Ophir for best actor, while co-star Khalifa Natour won best supporting actor. The awards are voted for by members of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television.\nIt is not clear, however, if Zohar can carry through with his threat: according to the Jerusalem Post, The Association for Civil Rights in Israel is investigating whether the culture ministry has the jurisdiction to pull funding from the awards.\nZohar has a history of confronting Israel’s film industry: in February he introduced a bill to reform film funding by pushing government money towards commercially successful productions, and said that the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land was “sabotage against the state of Israel”.\nVariety reported that The Sea’s Palestinian producer Baher Agbariya received the award with a plea for equality and tolerance, saying: “This film was born from love for humanity and cinema, and its message is one – the right of every child to live and dream in peace, without siege, without fear, and without war.” Protests against the war in Gaza were much in evidence at the ceremony, with participants wearing T-shirts bearing messages such as “a child is a child” and “end the war”.\nAgbariya also thanked the Israel Film Fund for supporting the film.\nVeteran director Uri Barbash, best known for the 1984 prison drama Beyond the Walls, was given a lifetime achievement award, and also called for an end to the war in his acceptance speech, saying. “It is our sacred duty to return all the kidnapped to the bosom of their families, and immediately, to end the damned war and replace the ‘divide and rule’ regime that declared war on Israeli society.”\nResponding to Zohar’s statement, Assaf Amir, chair of Israeli Academy of Film and Television, said: “In the face of the Israeli government’s attacks on Israeli cinema and culture, and the calls from parts of the international film community to boycott us, the selection of The Sea is a powerful and resounding response.”\nThe controversy follows a pledge signed by over 3,000 international film industry figures to boycott Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”. Olivia Colman, Javier Bardem, Riz Ahmed and Emma Stone were among the high-profile actors and film-makers to put their name to the letter.\nRepresentatives of the Israeli film industry called the boycott “deeply troubling”, with Nadav Ben Simon, chairman of the Israeli screenwriters’ guild, saying: “Over the years, we have also collaborated with Palestinian colleagues on films, series, and documentaries that seek to encourage dialogue, mutual understanding, peace and an end to violence … [Boycotts] do not advance the cause of peace. Instead, they harm precisely those who are committed to fostering dialogue and building bridges between peoples.”",

        "content": "My husband, Ulrich Loening, who has died aged 94, was a lecturer first in the botany and then in the zoology departments (now the molecular plant sciences and biological sciences departments) of Edinburgh University. He engaged in fundamental research and made significant contributions to the developing science of molecular biology.\nHe had always had a great interest and concern for the natural world. After the establishment by Conrad Waddington, a professor of genetics, of the school of the man-made future at Edinburgh, Ulrich became actively involved in environmental and green issues.\nIn 1984 Ulrich was appointed director of the Centre for Human Ecology (CHE) at the university. Human ecology was a new and developing concept, which broadened environmental science to encompass the study of all aspects of human behaviour that affects the biosphere.\nUlrich was born in Berlin to Lilli (nee Cohn) and Erich Loening, a photochemist who developed early colour printing methods and later worked for Kodak. His parents had moved from Berlin to London in 1937 to escape Nazi persecution. In Ulrich’s teenage years the family lived in Jordans, Buckinghamshire, a centre of Quakerism.\nAlthough he never became a member of the Society of Friends, he attended Quaker meetings and was influenced by their thinking. His interest in nature, in ecological issues and in organic agriculture stemmed from his early experiences in a rural environment, of gardening and keeping bees and chickens, and by Quaker concepts of self-sufficiency.\nUlrich went to Merchant Taylors’ school, north-west London, and then studied biochemistry at Wadham College, Oxford (where he also got his doctorate), graduating in 1954.\nWe met in Oxford in 1955, while performing music – Ulrich played the cello and I played the violin. We married in 1957 and moved to Edinburgh in 1959, where Ulrich first took up an Agricultural Research Council fellowship at the botanic gardens.\nIn 1992 Ulrich and some colleagues established the first master’s degree in human ecology. Although the CHE was closed in 1996, the MSc course continued to run via the Open University and later Strathclyde University.\nIn the early 1970s, together with four other families, we bought a derelict steading (farm buildings) and renovated what had been a coach house into a family home in Ormiston, East Lothian. A large garden made us self-sufficient in vegetables and fruit.\nAn adjacent piece of neglected woodland was acquired by the group, in which we planted more than 1,000 trees. Ulrich was a skilled woodworker and in 1958 made a cello. He built much of his own laboratory equipment.\nUlrich is survived by me, our three children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",

These statements will undoubtedly be taken into account.”\nShare\nParcel explosions in Europe linked to Russian intelligence, Lithuanian authorities say\nLithuanian authorities said they have identified 15 individuals behind four attempted terrorist acts in Germany, Poland and the UK involving exploding parcels and confirmed their links to Russian military intelligence.\nThe Lithuanian general prosecutor and the country’s criminal police said in a joint statement that they investigated four detonations or attempted detonations of parcels carried by DHL and DPD courier services last year.\nParcels were reported exploding at Leipzig airport in Germany, in a DPD freight truck in Poland, and in a DHL warehouse near Birmingham, the UK, while the fourth shipment failed to ignite.\nThe investigation – conducted together with officials from nine countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and the US – led them to a 42-year-old Lithuanian citizen, who they allege worked with accomplices, and sent the parcels from Vilnius, Lithuania.\nCrucially, the report said the coordination of the attacks was led by two Russian citizens “associated and having connections with the military intelligence services of the Russian Federation.”\nOther citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine were also reportedly involved, including through the Telegram messenger, with a total of 15 suspects. International arrest warrants have been issued against three of them.\nShare\nUpdated at 16.39 BST\nEuropean Commission calls for freezing of free trade with Israel over Gaza - full report\nJennifer Rankin\nin Brussels\nThe EU executive has called for a suspension of free trade with Israel and sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers in response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nUrsula von der Leyen had already floated the proposal to suspend the trade parts of the EU-Israel association agreement last week as the European Commission faced intense pressure for greater action amid criticism that it was not using its economic leverage to influence the Israeli government.\nThere is, however, no certain majority from EU member states for the proposals outlined on Wednesday, because Germany, one of Israel’s key allies, has long been reluctant to take such steps.\nThe proposals include suspending Israel’s preferential access to the European market by reimposing tariffs on some goods, and freezing mutual benefits related to bidding for public contracts and the protection of intellectual property rights.\nThe commission also called for sanctions on Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank and 10 Hamas leaders.\nThe plans were presented as Israeli forces pressed ahead with their offensive in Gaza City, deepening a conflict that has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages.\nShare\nParis police chief 'very concerned' about potential damage during union strikes\nThe Paris chief of police Laurent Nuñez said he was “very concerned” about the prospect of public disturbance on the margins of the trade union protests scheduled for Thursday, Le Figaro reported.\nNuñez claimed he had reports about plans to disrupt the protest with the intention to “fight and cause damage,” warning shopkeepers to protect their shop fronts, the paper said.\nThe strikes are intented to push back on what unions see as unfair austerity policies, AP said, as they reject cuts in social spending and pension reform. They are expected to prompt disruption in sectors like transport, public services, hospitals and schools.\nMore than 250 demonstrations are planned across the country, Le Monde said.\nShare\nIsrael warns EU's 'morally, politically distorted' sanctions will get 'appropriate response'\nMeanwhile, Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar warned the EU against taking action against Israel, after the bloc’s executive proposed curbing trade ties and sanctioning ministers over the Gaza war, AFP reported.\n“The recommendations of the college of Commissioners led by President (Ursula) von der Leyen are morally and politically distorted,” Saar wrote on X, adding that: “Moves against Israel will harm Europe’s own interests.”\n“Any action against Israel will receive an appropriate response, and we hope we will not have to use them,” he wrote.\nShare\nUpdated at 14.48 BST\nWidow of Alexei Navalny says lab tests confirm he was poisoned in prison - full report\nPjotr Sauer\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, said that two foreign laboratories had confirmed her husband was poisoned, after tests on biological samples secretly smuggled out of Russia (as reported 10:54).\nNavalny, 47, died suddenly on 16 February 2024, while being held in a jail about 40 miles (64km) north of the Arctic Circle, where he had been sentenced to decades in prison to be served in a “special regime”.\nNavalny’s allies have accused the Kremlin repeatedly of killing him – allegations Moscow has dismissed as absurd. Russian officials insist he died of a mixture of diseases, including heart arrhythmia triggered by hypertension.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday he was unaware of Navalnaya’s claims.\nNavalnaya, who lives abroad, posted a video on X in which she said biological material from Navalny was smuggled abroad in 2024 and then examined by two laboratories.\n“These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,” Navalnaya said, urging the two laboratories to release the findings.\n“These results are of public importance and must be published. We all deserve to know the truth,” she said.\nShe did not specify what poison the laboratories had found.\nNavalnaya also said the surveillance footage from the final day of her husband’s life had vanished, despite the opposition leader being under near-constant camera monitoring throughout his imprisonment.\nNavalny’s allies also released previously unseen photographs they said were taken inside the prison cell after his death. The images show a cramped cell with what appears to be vomit and blood on the floor, next to a notebook and an Oxford dictionary.\nLeonid Volkov, a close ally of Navalny, wrote on X that the opposition leader had been “murdered in an agonising way, with poison”.\nHe added: “No matter how much they tried to erase details from the medical records or cover their tracks, we know everything about his final day and the method of his killing.”\nThe regional penitentiary service said in a statement at the time of his death that Navalny “felt unwell after a walk and almost immediately lost consciousness”.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.02 BST\nTowards the end of the press conference, Kallas rejected suggestions that the EU has not done enough to put pressure on Israel and insisted the public opinion has shifted on this in recent months, as reflected by the proposed measures.\n“The proposals [are] now on the table to put more pressure on Israeli government … now it’s up to the member states to discuss [them] in the council, which is problematic, as we know of the lines.\nBut what it shows, really, it shows that the public opinion in all the member states has, has really shifted. And when we have the discussions, all the member states or representatives, foreign ministers, agree that the situation is untenable.\nSo if we all agree on this, then the question is, what do we do about this; what are the tools in our hands?\nAnd that’s why we have proposed, then from our commission, to go with these proposals. If these do not fly, then we can find other things, if we all agree that we need to do additional steps in order to have really change on the ground.”\nThis concludes the press conference.\nShare\nWhat EU's move on Israeli trade would mean in practice? - snap analysis\nLisa O’Carroll\nToday’s proposal by the European Commission to suspend trade parts of the EU Israeli association would not mean Israeli goods disappearing from European supermarkets, factories, or hospitals.\nIf adopted by the member states, who need to agree to it under qualified majority vote system (QMV), it would merely mean goods would no longer be duty free and subject to tariffs that apply to all non-EU countries that do not have a trade agreement with the bloc.\nThe EU is responsible for 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods with the world, selling some €16bn in 2024.\nIsraeli exports include everything from jet engines to pharmaceuticals including those from Teva. However, not all goods are exported under tariffs, as they are for example not imposed on pharmaceuticals under a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement.\nUnder the QMV system two conditions have to be met. 55% of member states need to back to the move. This means 15 out of 27 member states, but the bigger barrier is that the proposal must be supported by member states representing 65% of the total EU population.\nGermany represents 18% of the EU population, France 15% and Italy 11%.\nMaroš Šefčovič, the trade commissioner, admitted that the impact of the removal of free trade access, would be “modest”, as he told reporters that their suggestions that tariffs would amount to an additional cost of just €227m a year were “correct”.\nWhatever its economic consequences, it can be seen as a hugely symbolic move.\n“I would say the whole context of the decision was very political. … I think there was strong expectations that European Union have to use the tools at its disposal to address the humanitarian crisis,” he said.\nEU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, was also asked about whether she was confident about getting the suspension approved by the member states.\nShe said:\n“You know very well, how is the situation the council, although we see that … the public opinion in member states is really shifting because the suffering in Gaza and people really want to see [this stopped].\nI think we will have the discussions after these proposals are made, but I think the political lines are very much in the place where they have been so far.”\nShare\nUpdated at 13.03 BST\nEU's proposed Israel trade suspension 'appropriate, proportionate' given crisis in Gaza, EU's Šefčovič insists\nEU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič is now speaking about the practical consequences of the proposed measures.\n“In practice, this means that imports from Israel to the EU will lose the preferential access to the EU market, and that these goods will be charged duties at the level applied to any other third countries with whom the EU has no free trade agreement.\nWe regret having to take this step. However, we believe it is both appropriate and proportionate given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”\nŠefčovič said the total trade in goods amounted to €42.6bn in 2024, making the EU Israel’s number one trading partner.\n“In light of these figures and the principles at stake, the proposed partial suspension is a carefully considered response to an increasingly urgent situation,” he says.\nHe says the EU “believes that now is the time that we must work together to end also the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”\n“This means unrestrained access for humanitarian aid, the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas and an urgent ceasefire to stop the bloodshed.”\nUltimately, Israel needs real security and the Palestinian people need real dignity.\nHe says the member states will decide on this measure by a qualified majority.\nShare\nEU proposes to suspend trade parts of EU-Israel association agreement over war in Gaza\nLisa O’Carroll\nThe European Commission has proposed suspending some of the trade parts of the EU Israel association agreement, 18 months after Ireland and Spain asked commission president Ursula von der Leyen to review the agreement in light of the war in Gaza.\nFollowing her state of the union speech last week indicating a shift at the top of the EU, the Commission’s presented a proposal today.\nIn addition it has announced it had put bilateral support for Israel on hold with the exception of contributions to support civil society and the Yad Vashem holocaust museum. It also proposed sanctions on Hamas, extremist ministers and violent settlers.\nIn a statement, the EU said the proposal on the trade agreement follows a review of Article 2 of the association agreement following “the blockade of humanitarian aid, the intensifying of military operations and the decision of the Israeli authorities to advance the settlement plan in the so-called E1 area of the West Bank”.\nThe proposed suspension must be ratified by member states who are already blocking a European Commission proposal to suspend Israel from part of the Horizon European science research programme.\nFollow our Middle East blog for more updates:\nShare\nPoland calls to end Russian oil imports to EU by end 2026\nPolish energy minister Miłosz Motyka has called on the EU to end Russian oil imports by the end of 2026 “to cease financing Russia’s war machine” and help end the war in Ukraine.\nIn a letter sent to other EU energy ministers just days after Russian drones incursion into Polish airspace, seen by the Guardian, Motyka argued that “the current international circumstances, combined with the need to strengthen the resilience of European economies, require a common response.”\nHe said that a commitment to the 2026 deadline would “establish a clear timeline, and demonstrate our resolve to achieve independence from oil supplies burdened with political and strategic risks.”\nPoland also called for “coordinated … compensatory mechanisms” to help with “a fair and orderly transition” for countries most affected, which would also include measures on “safeguarding access to alternative oil sources in the event of disruptions.”\nReuters noted that the Druzhba oil pipeline delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, which continue to buy energy supplies from Russia after other EU nations cut ties following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThe letter comes a day after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she would propose speeding phasing out of Russian fossil imports after her call with US president Donald Trump last night.\nThe bloc had previously intended to end purchases of Russian oil and gas by 2028.\nTrump repeatedly called on the EU and Nato countries to stop buying oil from Russia, seemingly making it a condition of future US sanctions on Moscow.\nShare\nGround-based air and missile defence system purchase 'largest single investment in Danish defence ever,' ministry says\nThe total package for acquisition and operation of ground-based air and missile defence systems is estimated to be worth 58 billion kroner, equivalent to €7.7bn or £6.74bn, “the largest single investment ever in Danish defence.”\nThe defence ministry’s press release outlined some details of the proposed purchases, saying that that Denmark will look to procure the French-Italian SAMP/T NG air defence system for the long-range missiles, and “one or more” from the Norwegian NASAMS, the German IRIS-T or the French VL MICA systems.\nIt said that “the decision to go with more than one or two suppliers enable shorter delivery times” and reaching readiness “as quickly as possible.” The first system is expected to be operational this year.\nShare\n'Russia wants conflict with Nato,' Danish PM warns, as she warns Moscow keeps 'pushing the boundaries'\nMiranda Bryant\nNordic correspondent\nFrederiksen insisted that the move is not an escalation but that it is a “political choice”.\n“We are making a political choice about what it means to be able to defend ourselves,” she said. “To put it bluntly, it’s not enough to have an air defence to keep out what’s out there. You have to show your will to be able to do more.”\nRussia, she said, is “constantly trying to push the boundaries” and “wants conflict with Nato.”\nReferencing Russia’s recent violation of Polish airspace, she said: “They will continue to see what reaction comes. That’s why it’s also the right time to make this decision.”\nShe said:\nRussia wants conflict with Nato. But the Danes should not go around fearing a military attack right now.\nShare\n'Necessary ... to be able to counter threats before they reach our territory,' Denmark says\nMiranda Bryant\nNordic correspondent\nThe Danish ministry of defence said in a press release:\n“Based on the military-technical recommendation of the Chief of Defence, the government has made a decision in principle that Denmark must have long-range precision weapons.”\nIt added that the move is being carried out “with a view to strengthening Denmark’s national and Nato and allies’ collective deterrence.”\nDenmark’s chief of defence, Michael Hyldgaard, said:\n“It is necessary for the Armed Forces to be able to counter threats before they reach our territory. It is about giving the Armed Forces the right tools to solve the task. We are getting that now.”\nShare",

        "title": "Trump DoJ seeks to kill Vermont law that makes big oil pay for climate harm",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.\nIn a brief filed on Monday in a federal court in Burlington, the administration said the policy was “unlawful on its face” and pushed the court to “end Vermont’s lawless experiment”.\n“The Court should deny the motions to dismiss, grant the United States’ motion for summary judgment, declare the Superfund Act unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to implement or enforce it,” Riley Walters, counsel to an acting assistant attorney general, wrote in the motion.\nPassed in 2024, the Vermont policy – known as the Climate Superfund Act – requires major polluters to pay for their carbon emissions, which have warmed the planet and increased the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as the floods which wreaked $1bn in damage on the state last year. New York passed a similar measure in December.\n“This law is about holding big oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s Climate Superfund law. “Vermont is well within its rights to protect its people in this way.”\nThe filing comes four months after the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency sued Vermont and New York over the laws. In August, the state and two non-profits who were granted intervenor status, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.\nKate Sinding Daly, senior vice-president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.\n“Let’s be clear: this law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions, punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” she said. “This is Vermont using its legal right to raise revenue and protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of its residents from the ruinous, inescapable consequences of climate change.”\nThe motion is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to quash climate accountability efforts and environmental regulations. In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.\nIn July, the administration proposed undoing the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which says planet-warming emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act – the most audacious of more than 150 environmental rollbacks launched since Trump retook office in January.\nJamie Henn, director of the anti-fossil fuel non-profit Fossil Free Media, which backs the superfund laws, said Trump’s assault would not deter efforts to bring about financial accountability for global warming. Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.",

        "content": "Israeli troops pressed ahead with a ground offensive into Gaza City on Wednesday, making further efforts to force more people to flee their homes and travel to overcrowded and unsafe areas in the south of the devastated territory.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday they had carried out 150 air and artillery strikes ahead of the ground operation that began early on Tuesday morning.\nTwo army divisions are working their way slowly towards the city centre and are expected to be joined by a third in the coming days.\nSeveral of the airstrikes brought down apartment blocks in the midst of tented camps inhabited by displaced people. Israel claims the buildings were being used by Hamas for surveillance.\nOn Tuesday night Gaza City’s al-Rantisi children’s hospital was hit. According to the Gaza health ministry, half the hospital’s 80 patients managed to flee the building but the rest, including four children in intensive care and eight premature babies, remained.\nOvernight strikes killed 16 people, according to local hospitals, bringing the total Palestinian death toll in two years of war to 65,000. On Tuesday, a UN human rights commission published a report concluding that Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza.\nThe coast road leading south from Gaza City has been packed with families trying to flee the offensive. On Wednesday, the IDF announced the opening of a second route, through the middle of the Gaza Strip, for two days to try to encourage the exodus.\nHowever, many residents of Gaza City and the rest of the north are very unlikely to have received any of the text messages or social media posts put out by the IDF because strikes in the region have damaged the telephone network.\nOf the million Palestinians living in and around Gaza City, the Israeli military estimates 350,000 people have left and moved south over the past month. The UN estimate is 238,000, including about 50,000 in the last 48 hours.\nThe United Nations voiced grave concerns on Wednesday about food and other supplies running out in northern Gaza, where many are already experiencing famine, after Israel closed the only crossing there last week.\n“There are grave concerns over fuel and food stock depletion in a matter of days as there are now no direct aid entry points into northern Gaza and resupply from south to north is increasingly challenging due to mounting road congestion and insecurity,” the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement.\nContrary to Israeli claims, none of the Palestinians interviewed by the Guardian in recent weeks have said they came under pressure from Hamas to stay in the city. Many residents said they had been unable or reluctant to leave for multiple other reasons.\nSome are physically unable to move, weakened by many months of near starvation, and some cannot afford the costs of transport or the price of a rudimentary plastic sheeting tent at their destination.\nVery many consider the south to be as dangerous as Gaza City. Israel has frequently bombed the “humanitarian zone” it established at al-Mawasi. The sprawling camp there was hit by an Israeli strike overnight, killing two parents and their child.\nMany Israeli security officials, including the IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, have privately questioned the wisdom of the offensive, in terms of its human cost and because they think there is little chance it will achieve its stated goal of the total destruction of Hamas.\nThere have been no security checks of the mass of people fleeing south, so most observers believe it probable that Hamas militants will regroup elsewhere. IDF officials have estimated there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters ready for battle in the city centre, but IDF intelligence estimates suggest that is only a small fraction of their surviving forces.\nMany Israeli observers and commentators believe the real motives for the offensive are political: to keep Israel in a state of war so as to fend off early elections in which Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-right coalition could be unseated, and to make Gaza City uninhabitable so as to put pressure on Palestinians to leave and for other countries to receive them.\nCogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that administers access to Gaza, on Wednesday issued advice to Palestinians in the territory who wanted to leave.\nBezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, described Gaza as a “real estate bonanza” on Wednesday, Hebrew media reported.\nSpeaking a property development conference in Tel Aviv, Smotrich said he was talking to “the Americans” and that “the demolition, the first stage in the city’s renewal, we have already done. Now we just need to build.”",

        "title": "Gout Gout channels Bolt, horses and butterflies ahead of semi-final test",
        "content": "An unenviable draw and his struggle to get out of the blocks will almost certainly end the debut of Gout Gout at the world championships in his semi-final on Thursday, but the teenager remains upbeat about his prospects having survived his first major international test.\nThe Australian overcame a ponderous first 30m to finish third in his heat in 20.23sec, the 12th fastest time across all qualifiers for the semis.\nGiven eight athletes will progress to the final, Gout might be considered a chance, especially given he cruised through the final 50m of his heat.\nHe has stated his ambition for the meet is to break the 20-second barrier. He ran 19.84sec in April, but with a 2.2m/s tailwind the time was scratched from the records, and his personal best is the 20.02sec he ran in Czechia in June.\n“Sub-20, that’s the goal, so let’s see in the semi,” Gout said. “Just go out there, run like a horse, run like the wind.”\nHis hopes of progressing have been hampered by what appears to be, like football’s group of death, a semi-final of suffering.\nOnly two will qualify directly for the final, with another two across all three semis going through based on fastest times. Of the nine athletes in Gout’s heat, five have run sub-20, and four of those have come this season.\nOlympic champion Letsile Tebogo and Bryan Levell – who easily beat the Australian in the heats and last month set a PB of 19.69sec – will give Gout a first-hand demonstration of how much improvement is needed in coming years before the 17-year-old can compete for medals in the 200m.\nGout described Levell as “fast” to Channel Nine after the race. “He took off very fast and he held it, so congratulations to him,” he said.\nLevell had made up the stagger on Gout midway around the bend, and the teenager’s splits show just how slow he was getting out of the blocks. At the 30m mark, World Athletics timing had him placed last in the heat.\nTo recover and comfortably run 20.23sec highlights Gout’s top-end speed. But even before he turned on cruise control down the straight, he was struggling to make up ground on Levell or second-place Zimbabwean Makanakaishe Charamba.\n“I’ve just got to take the experience into the semi-finals,” Gout said. “Hopefully I get a good start, and then I’m off like a butterfly.”\nWith his forehead dripping in the Tokyo humidity, the teenager said after the race he tried to remind himself to stay calm.\n“Like, this is what you do every day, you train, you do blocks every day, you do speed workouts every day, so it is just another training session,” he told SBS.\n“Even though this is the biggest stage in the world, you’ve just got to go out there, treat it like a training session.”\nHaving been in Tokyo since last Friday, Gout said he had felt the expectation building ahead of Wednesday’s performance, but he is trying to enjoy himself.\n“Obviously, there’s going to be expectation wherever I go, so it is what it is, and I’ve just got to go out there and do my thing and have a bit of fun.”\nGout has already done something even the great Usain Bolt couldn’t and progress beyond his first heat at his first major international meet.\nBolt was eliminated in the first round of the 200m at the 2004 Athens Olympics at age 18, serving as a reminder that Gout’s potential remains immense, whatever the semi-final result.\nThe Australian played down the comparison with the Jamaican.\n“I just got out of the [heat] so it is definitely great to know that I’m up against the top 24 in the world, it’s a great experience,” the Australian said, calling Bolt “the goat”, slang for the greatest of all time.\n“He’s the athlete everyone looks up to, so I’m just going to keep looking up to him and trying to be like him, too.”",

        "title": "One Battle After Another review - Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caper",
        "content": "One of the great creative bromances has flowered again: Paul Thomas Anderson and Thomas Pynchon. Having adapted Pynchon’s Inherent Vice for the screen in 2015, Anderson has now taken a freer rein with his 1990 novel Vineland, creating a bizarre action thriller driven by pulpy comic-book energy and transformed political indignation, keeping his pedal at all times welded to the metal.\nIt’s a riff on the now recognisable Anderson-Pynchonian idea of counterculture and counter-revolution, absorbing the paranoid style of American politics into a screwball farcical resistance, with a jolting, jangling, nerve-shredding score by Jonny Greenwood. It’s partly a freaky-Freudian diagnosis of father-daughter dysfunction – juxtaposed with the separation of migrant children and parents at the US-Mexico border – and a very serious, relevant response to the US’s secretive ruling class and its insidiously normalised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) roundups: the toxic new Vichyite Trump enthusiasm.\nPynchon imagined the subversiveness of the 60s having its contested sequel in the Reaganite 80s; Anderson brings the time gap between these eras into the present day, although there isn’t the a cultural distinction between what are evidently the last days of Obama and contemporary Trump pomp. Specific references such as Maga and BLM aren’t mentioned.\nLeonardo DiCaprio is Bob, a dishevelled revolutionary, who is to become even more dishevelled in the future when he will do a great deal of panicky running through the streets in his dressing gown, whining that he has nowhere to charge his phone. Bob is part of a heavily armed activist cell that attacks migrant holding prisons on the Mexican border; Bob’s (humble) job is to set off fireworks as a diversionary-slash-celebratory tactic, and he is less important than his comrades, such as badass Deandra (Regina Hall) and cerebral Howard (played in cameo by composer and Yale academic Paul Grimstad).\nBob is passionately devoted to his partner and charismatic comrade, interestingly named Perfidia (Teyana Taylor). And Bob is not the only one. When the group attack the military compound, Perfidia captures and humiliates the aggressively reactionary Col Steven Lockjaw – played by Sean Penn with all manner of lizardly head-jerking, chin-jutting geezer mannerisms – who clearly derives sexual excitement from the whole business, and his creepy, cartoony unwholesomeness is another driving force. With the cold calculation of a born leader, Perfidia sees how she can toy with Lockjaw’s infatuation, using him to control and divert military opposition. Does she take it too far? Does the idea of taking things too far in fact have any meaning in this context? Perfidia deafeningly firing an assault rifle while in the ninth month of her pregnancy is one of the film’s most amazing images.\nIt is poor, befuddled Bob’s destiny to bring up a daughter he thinks is his, as a single dad. Sixteen-year-old Willa (Chase Infiniti) is as smart and focused as her mom, instructed in martial arts by her sensei (Benicio del Toro), while Bob gets more messed up on drugs and booze all day, watching Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers on TV, grumpily refusing to remember her friends’ preferred pronouns. But the forces of darkness encircle them once more, and when his old revolutionary friends re-emerge to contact him, Bob realises his brain is too fried to remember the all-important code words on the phone. As for Willa, she is now stuck with troubled thoughts about her mother and a mortifying question concerning Bob and Lockjaw, like the heroine of Mamma Mia! The Movie.\nOne Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen – an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream?\nMaybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.",

        "title": "Trump’s war on science leaves US public health experts reeling: ‘There will be lasting damage’",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s second presidency has spelled upheaval or worse for multiple spheres of US government. But for science – long a key driver of the US’s global pre-eminence – it has heralded the perfect storm.\nIn public health, climate science, environmental protection and nuclear safety, seasoned career specialists have been left bewildered and often jobless under a ferocious onslaught from the president, apparently aimed at gaining control over a sector about which he has displayed strongly held views, if frequently flawed understanding.\nNow, experts warn, the US faces a loss of scientific expertise across multiple fronts that could takes decades to restore in a purge that has seen thousands of government scientists fired and billions of dollars slashed from research programs that were previously deemed vital.\nSome observers compare Trump’s offensive to contemporary authoritarian regimes such as Hungary and Russia under Vladimir Putin. One even likens it to the ruthless efforts of Hitler and Stalin to bring scientists to heel in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.\n“The Trump administration is trying to undermine the scientific method as a basis of making determinations, both in the scientific field and for application to improve public policy,” said Paul Josephson, emeritus professor at Colby College in Maine, and a specialist in the history of 20th-century science and technology.\n“It is designating which kinds of science are good and which are inappropriate. It’s come up with a list of terms that should not be mentioned in scientific articles, or end research that disproportionately [focuses on] women, trans people, black people or people of color.”\nJosephson cited the phenomenon of “Lysenkoism” – named after the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko, who rejected genetics and science-based agriculture – as an example of the long-term dangers of top-down dogmatic beliefs. Lysenko’s pseudo-scientific beliefs were backed by Stalin and led to the arrest, imprisonment and, in some cases, even execution of dissenting scientists.\nThe Trump administration’s approach captured headlines last month when the White House fired Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after she clashed with Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, over vaccine policy.\nMonarez, an infectious diseases specialist who had been in her post for just a month, wrote that she was ordered to pre-approve the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel due to meet this month that had been filled with people with anti-vaccine views.\nKennedy expounded his own hardline anti-vaccine opinions in heated testimony before a Senate committee last week, where he faced Democrat calls to resign as he defended his purge of federal public health agencies, which have undergone mass staff cuts since he was confirmed in office.\nYet his actions have been part of a broader canvas in the war against science.\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit group, documented 402 incidents it defined as “attacks on science” between Trump’s 20 January inauguration and the end of June.\nThese included firing or demoting federal scientists, halting data collection in scientific studies by federal agencies, censoring scientists and rolling back regulations based on sound scientific evidence. There have also been moves to restrict access to data, reports and guidance.\nTrump signaled his determination to bring science under his direct ambit in an executive order issued in May entitled “restoring gold standard science”.\nIt claimed that “confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly.” It blamed “the falsification of data by leading researchers” for his own administration’s termination of numerous federal research grants.\nAnother order issued last month vowed closer scrutiny of National Science Foundation grants, citing an unidentified “study” that claimed one-quarter of such awards in 2024 went to “diversity, equity, and inclusion and other far-left initiatives”.\nJennifer Jones, director of the center for science and democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, US science was undergoing an “unprecedented … assault from all angles”.\n“They’re sidelining science,” she said. “At the same time, they’re uplifting junk science and quackery that’s going to help and support their billionaire [supporters] and bottom lines.”\nThe effects, she warned, would endure. “There will be lasting damage, and it will likely take multiple political administrations to get over and to rebuild what has been lost.”\nAmong the most affected areas are:\nPublic health\nAccording to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Department of Health and Human Services shed nearly a quarter (24%) of its staff, about 20,000 workers, between Trump’s return to office and mid-May – the highest proportion of any federal science agency.\nBefore the row that triggered Monarez’s firing, Kennedy cancelled $500m in funding for the development of mRNA vaccines – which are currently used for Covid-19 but subject to research as a treatment for a host of other conditions, including certain cancers, HIV, rabies and Zika.\nOn 27 May, the administration cancelled a $590m contract with Moderna supporting the development of a bird flu vaccine.\nKennedy also announced that the CDC would no longer recommend Covid booster shots for healthy children and pregnant women. He falsely claimed that recommendations of repeat boosters for children were unsupported by clinical data.\nTrump had previously issued an executive order prohibiting Covid mandates in schools.\nAnother order in May halted research into “dangerous gain-of-function (GOF) research” on viruses and pathogens – claiming that such research was being carried out without sufficient oversight and citing the unsubstantiated theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from a lab in China that used similar research methods.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has limited access to Covid shots, saying only people over 65 and those at high risk of complications from the virus need them.\nAmid this intense vaccine-hostility, groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association – as well as at least one Republican senator, Bill Cassidy – have accused the administration of denying vaccines to people who want them.\nConcerns extend beyond vaccine policy. Last week, Kennedy was accused of burying a report – commissioned during Joe Biden’s presidency and submitted to the health department in March – that posited evidence of a link between alcohol and cancer. Critics say the stance contradicts Kennedy’s self-proclaimed make America health again (Maha) agenda.\nAmong numerous firings at the National Institute of Health were staff researching into Alzheimer’s disease at the institute’s center for Alzheimer’s and related dementias (Card), ABC News reported. They included Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen, who had been earmarked as the center’s next acting director.\nThe CDC is also eliminating its drowning prevention program, established in response to a spike of drowning incidents during the Covid pandemic. More than 4,000 people drown in the US each year, and it is the leading cause of death among children aged one to four.\nClimate\nAbout 800 researchers, meteorologists and engineers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) were fired in February in a move specialists warned would impede vital hurricane forecasting and climate modeling work.\nA further 10 fellows from a postdoctoral program on climate and global change run by the agency were put on unpaid leave in July. Meanwhile, the commerce department indefinitely suspended work on part of Noaa’s Atlas 15 program, which provides data on extreme rainfalls and how they are affected by climate change.\nThe administration’s budget proposal for 2026 envisions a $1.52bn cut to Noaa’s allocation, with cuts specifically targeting climate programs.\nThe White House’s office of management and budget (OMB) also proposes a $20.29bn cut to the energy department, with its office of science budget targeted for a $1.15m reduction.\nThe administration has marginalized the national climate assessment, despite it being mandated by Congress to be conducted every four years. In April, it dismissed 400 volunteer experts who had prepared to work on the latest assessment.\nAs of the end of June, national climate assessments were no longer available on federal government websites, with no explanation or links to alternative sources provided, according to Columbia University’s Sabin center for climate change law.\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon announced that it would stop providing atmospheric and oceanic data to scientists and weather forecasters, citing “cybersecurity concerns”.\nEnvironmental protection\nLast month, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rescinding the endangerment finding, a 2009 scientific determination that greenhouse gases endanger human health, and instead interpret its authority narrowly under the Clean Air Act. Experts say such a move threatens the legal basis for federal climate regulation.\nThe EPA also announced plans to eliminate its office of research and development – long seen as the linchpin of its mission to protect the environment and human health – and replace it with a new office of applied science and environmental solutions. In so doing, it is set to cut its workforce by 3,700 – down by nearly a quarter since Trump took office.\nLast week, the EPA disclosed it was no longer prepared to uphold rules designed to protect people from unsafe levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas ) – also known as “forever chemicals – in drinking water. It asked a federal court to reverse legal protections against four such chemicals put in place by Congress just last year.\nOn Tuesday, the agency said it would end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) – a move that it said would end the obligations of about 8,000 large business concerns in the US to report their carbon emissions and save businesses $2.4bn over the next decade. Lee Zeldin, the EPA’s Trump-appointed administrator, dismissed the program as “bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality”.\nTrump has issued a series of orders undercutting clean energy initiatives, fueled by his frequently expressed antipathy towards wind turbines.\n“We have a president who rejects wind power because he says it makes whales go nuts,” said Josephson, the Colby College historian. “He claims that wind power is unsafe and that it’s not good otherwise for the nation, but [the real reason] is to support the fossil fuel industry. By doing that, he will give the leadership to European countries, and especially to China, in the areas of wind power.”\nNuclear safety\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the US’s nuclear safety watchdog, has lost nearly 200 staff since Trump’s inauguration – amounting to a “brain drain” of expertise that former officials say raises the risk of future accidents.\nNearly half of the agency’s 28-strong senior leadership team have been installed in an “acting” capacity, while only three of its five commissioners’ positions are filled.\nThe Financial Times quoted a Scott Morris, a recently retired former deputy executive director of operations, as calling the staffing situation, in which some senior leaders have been pushed out, “unprecedented”.\nTwo dozen nuclear reactors are currently under development in the US, prompting Morris to warn that replacing qualified professionals with politically motivated appointees at the agency would be “a dangerous game” that could lead to serious problems going undetected until years in the future.",

        "title": "Borderlands 4 review - the chaotic, colourful shooter has finally grown up a little",
        "content": "Once a games franchise hits its fourth outing, it is certainly mature – yet maturity is not a word generally associated with Borderlands, the colourful and performatively edgy looter-shooter from Texas. This series is characterised by a pervasive and polarising streak of distinctly adolescent humour. But in Borderlands 4, developer Gearbox has addressed that issue: it features plenty of returning characters in its storyline, but this time around they are more world-weary and less annoyingly manic. Borderlands has finally matured, to an extent. And not before time.\nBorderlands 4 still flings jokes at you thick and fast, and they are still hit-or-miss, but at least its general humour is a bit more sophisticated than before. It retains the distinctive cel-shaded graphical style and gun and ordnance-heavy gameplay that people have always loved. Indeed, it throws even more guns at you than any of its predecessors, and with a little work at filtering out the best ones, you will find plenty of absolute gems with which to take on hordes of straightforward enemies and more interesting bosses. A decent storyline emerges after the formulaic first few hours, eventually sending you off on some unexpected, fun and sometimes gratifyingly surreal tangents.\nThe action takes place on Kairos, a planet new to the series, which feels more coherent than any of Borderlands’ previous settings. Kairos’s inhabitants are suffering under the totalitarian yoke of the tyrant Timekeeper, so you must rouse the downtrodden natives into joining your resistance movement, liberating tribes of folk by eliminating the Timekeeper’s oppressive lieutenants and removing surveillance-and-control implants from their necks. The deeper you get into the story, the more sidetracks and digressions you find, from dungeon-like vaults stashed with loot to environmental puzzles.\nYou play as one of four vault-hunters – a Siren with summoning powers, an Exosoldier super-soldier, a hammer-wielding tank called a Forgeknight and a tech-wielding Gravitar. Each has battlefield skills that are crucial when you’re up against it, giving you the chance to spawn scythe-wielding phantom reapers, turrets, or defensive shields. The usual high-quality shooting is present and correct, but movement has been greatly improved: you get a grapple, a hover-bike and a huge jump-and-glide, all of which come in handy in the heat of frenetic battle and when you’re out exploring. They also translate well to the series’ famed co-op play, which supports up to four players.\nBorderlands 4 is a big game – the main storyline takes 20 to 30 hours to complete, and there’s plenty to do afterwards. It is not entirely frictionless: sometimes you need to traverse huge distances in its missions, and the directional indicator that helps you along the way is annoyingly erratic. And it has been buggy at launch: playing on PC, it has occasionally crashed on me, even after a huge patch, and early players have reported problems with stuttering and other performance issues. But Borderlands needed to grow up a bit, and that’s exactly what it has done, without losing its essential charm. Its top-quality shooter action might be comfortably familiar, but it’s also an awful lot less annoying than it used to be.",

How much would he sue for if he thought they were doing well?”\n“He won’t win this. The New York Times won’t settle,” Kimmel noted. “Besides how ridiculous it is, this might be one of the funniest legal documents I’ve ever seen. It’s quite a tongue bath.” One page lists Trump’s “hundreds of history-making appearances” including WrestleMania V, All My Children, Ghosts Can’t Do It, Two Weeks Notice, the Miss America pageants and “much more”.\n“This is quite a resume,” Kimmel deadpanned. “You know he met Melania on 90 Day Fiance.”\nMeanwhile, “many in Maga-land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”. On Monday, JD Vance, who once called Trump “America’s Hitler”, hosted Kirk’s podcast from the White House and blamed the left, without evidence. Said Vance: “While our side of the aisle certainly has its crazies, it is a statistical fact that most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left.”\n“And by ‘statistical fact’, he means ‘complete bullshit’,” Kimmel corrected. In fact, the Department of Justice removed from its website a study finding that violence from far-right groups is the greatest source of domestic terror and extremist violence in the US. “Here’s a question JD Vance might be able to answer: who wanted to hang the guy who was vice president before you?” Kimmel said. “Was that the liberal left? Or the toothless army who stormed the Capitol on January 6.”\n“The president and his henchmen are doing their best to fan the flames, so they can I guess attack people on the dangerous left,” Kimmel added, noting the incongruence with the right’s former vision of so-called “snowflake” liberals. “Which is it?” he wondered. “Are they a bunch of sissy pickleball players because they’re too scared to get hit by tennis balls? Or are they a well-organized army of commandos? Because they can’t be both.”\nStephen Colbert\nOn the Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated the show’s first Emmy win for outstanding variety talk series with their trophy on stage. “Man, I’m telling you, we should’ve gotten cancelled years ago,” he joked.\n“This award belongs to all 200 of the incredibly hardworking people who make this show,” he said. “First and foremost, the writers of this show” as well as the “stage crew, production staff, talent, segment editors, the band, control room, props, graphics, research, footage, digital, accounting, legal, wardrobe, makeup, security, maintenance, assistants and interns”.\n“And, of course, the audience department who let in all of you gorgeous people every night,” he added. “You are the ones who ultimately make this show possible. So this belongs to you, but I’m going to keep it.”\n“Speaking of Emmys, Donald Trump doesn’t have one,” he continued. “Also, right now, he’s out of the country, making his second state visit to the UK. But for a state visit, Trump is going to be keeping it surprisingly low profile.” The President will stay behind closed doors at Windsor Castle, far from massive planned protests and without delivering a traditional address to potential critics in Parliament. Still, protesters managed to unfurl a giant banner on the castle lawn with an old picture of Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein.\n“What are they going to do with it after Trump’s state visit?” Colbert wondered. “‘Children, we have a donation of a very unfortunate parachute for today’s gym class.’”\nWhile he’s there, Trump will be treated to an opulent banquet at Windsor Castle and a carriage ride through the grounds. “Oh, the pageantry!” Colbert joked. “He’s just like Cinderella, but good luck slipping the glass slipper on those cankles.”\nSeth Meyers\nAnd on Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped a New York Times investigation into how the Trump family made $2bn in cryptocurrency deals with the UAE, in exchange for giving the Emirati government access to advanced AI chips. “Who am I to say that these two things are connected?” Meyers joked. “It’s totally possible that Donald Trump Sr was negotiating the chips deal while Donald Trump Jr was negotiating the crypto deal, and they had no idea until it was time to sign the contract, and then they both showed up at the same restaurant at the same time and said ‘Don, what are you doing here?’”\n“This is obviously, ludicrously corrupt,” he said. When a reporter asked Trump on Tuesday about his business deals, Trump pivoted to “what has recently become his favorite topic”: the new White House ballroom, which Trump said “will knock your socks off”.\n“Stop talking about the fucking ballroom!” Meyers begged. “No one gives a shit about the ballroom. Prices are skyrocketing and our freedoms are disappearing all around us, and you’re going on about a ballroom like a fop from Dangerous Liaisons.”\n“You think the farmers in Iowa who voted for you are sitting down for coffee at their local diners saying, ‘well, the tariffs are killing my business, but at least the White House will finally have a place to hold fancy proms?’”\nMeyers also mocked Trump for threatening the Australian reporter who asked about the UAE deals with reporting on him to the Australian prime minister during their next visit.\n“What a fucking tattletale,” Meyers laughed. “Also you think you’re going to scare an Australian? They live in a country that’s mostly an unlivable desert, they have spiders the size of tennis rackets, but he’s shaking in his boots because you’re going to tell on him?”\nMeyers did point out, however, that Trump’s approval rating is at an all-time low. “It might feel like he’s just getting away with all this outlandish corruption and the erosion of our rights while Democrats and the media acquiesce, but most Americans are firmly opposed to this stuff,” he said. “They’re counting down the days until something changes.”",

        "title": "I know many are deeply opposed to Trump’s visit. But Keir Starmer doesn’t have that luxury",
        "content": "Has any visiting leader ever seen so little of Britain or the British as Donald Trump is doing this week? The absurdly unrepresentative version of the country offered up to the US president on his second state visit on Wednesday was a Windsor parody, a Potemkin version of this country, glistening with protocol and polish, amid a lavish reenactment of the British monarchy’s invented traditions. Just about the only thing that was authentic was the rain.\nBut here’s the unalterable and underlying thing. None of that really matters. What matters is that Trump is the most powerful leader in the world. Despite all the Trumpian shocks, the US and Britain remain allies. Business can and should be done between them. So the opportunity for face-time with Trump, in circumstances designed to soften him up with flattery and engage him over this country’s own priorities, is to be seized. Not to do this would be perverse.\nNo, it is not ideal. The era of shared values is ebbing fast. Keir Starmer did not need to play the state visit card so soon or so generously. He should have made Trump wait for the invitation, extracting a higher price for it, and offering hints that it might be offered in return for the right deal. But Starmer is not alone in struggling to read a president who is both unserious and utterly serious at the same time. All nations are still trying to work out how to respond.\nThe justification for inviting him for a second state visit is thus pure raison d’état – a reward for bad behaviour that is nevertheless in the British national interest. This may not be personally agreeable to some of those taking part, or to millions of others at home or on the streets. It may even not be very moral. Many – perhaps from the king downwards – will bite their tongues over these two distasteful days. All the same, it is necessary work.\nIt is also even more necessary in Trump’s second term than it was in the first. Trump’s victory in 2024 was more emphatic than in 2016 and his preparation for his White House return was far more thorough. From day one, his agenda, at home and abroad, has been more radical, more audacious, and in many respects is also proving more successful. Let others denounce this. Governments must engage or fall beneath his wheel.\nThree things will matter in particular when Trump meets Starmer on Thursday for the political half of the visit: trade, the Middle East and Ukraine. Views will differ on the top priority. The major technological investment that Peter Mandelson nurtured in his months as ambassador in Washington seems already locked in, a material legacy of a job done well, if briefly. On the Middle East, meanwhile, the immediate goal must be to prevent Trump exploding when Britain and others recognise Palestine next week.\nSo raison d’état says that pressure on Trump over Ukraine needs to come first. Russia’s threat to Europe is existential. Long term, the solution to that is in Europe’s own hands. The idea that the US should continue to be primarily responsible for Europe’s security 80 years after the second world war is now barely credible. But Starmer still needs to do whatever he can to press Trump to arm Ukraine more now. If nothing else, the prime minister should stress the shocking inconsistency between the administration’s tough sanctions on China and India for buying Russian gas while not going after Russia itself on the battlefield.\nMany will recoil from the engagement with Trump. Those of us who are not government ministers or diplomats have the luxury of being able to do so. That’s not an option for Starmer. Since it is in the national interest to try to influence Trump, it is part of Starmer’s duty to try. He clearly accepts that it is part of his job. He is right. If Starmer visits China in the coming weeks, he will be right about that part of it, too.\nThere are, of course, multiple reasons why Trump’s state visit can and should be criticised. The principal reason is that Trump is doing harm – a lot of it. So his visit is not an occasion for celebration but for damage limitation. That is the unspoken reason why it is taking place behind steel walls and closed doors. But that does not invalidate it. A realist might even say it makes the visit more necessary rather than less.\nThe tightly controlled programme and the brevity of Trump’s stay are a recognition of the obvious risks and possible provocations. A decade ago, China’s paramount leader, Xi Jinping, was granted the full gilded coach treatment along the Mall – not to mention a trip to Manchester as well. Back in 1978, even the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, a man with blood on his hands, rode through London with the royals in an open-topped coach. No such treatment for Trump this time.\nIt may all go off the rails, perhaps at Thursday’s Chequers press conference, where journalists will try their best to provoke Trump. Even if that does happen, though, the visit will still have been worthwhile. At best, it may produce the trade and tech agreements worked on by Mandelson, and perhaps help generate greater US robustness towards Russia and Israel. Even at worst, it will be another reminder to Britain and its more dependable allies that a new version of the international economic and security order is still salvageable from the damage being done by Trump. The important thing is to keep options open, not to close them off.",

        "title": "Sir Nicholas Grimshaw obituary",
        "content": "Of all the so-called “high tech” architects who began their careers in the London of the 1960s, Nicholas Grimshaw, who has died aged 85, was perhaps the most interested in skill. He never built a swaggering, colourful masterpiece like Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers’s Pompidou Centre. He did not shape the international architectural language of global modernism in the way that Norman Foster has done. But Grimshaw did have the ability to temper his excitement for the potential of shiny, machine-made precision with a passion for skilful craftsmanship at a highly detailed level.\nHe put the two together to build the remarkable international terminal at Waterloo Station, London, in 1993. Its skeletal, serpentine roof demonstrates Grimshaw’s fascination for the exposed structures of gothic cathedrals and the Victorian daring of Joseph Paxton and Brunel that he always loved. Structurally, Waterloo’s roof was the product of the engineering brilliance of Grimshaw’s long-term collaborator Tony Hunt. But it was Grimshaw and his team who lovingly oversaw the fabrication of every component and left them almost unnervingly exposed, like the giant bones of the dinosaur fossils in the Natural History Museum. Grimshaw himself said that his architecture “glorifies construction, and the beauty of the way things go together”.\nIt was Grimshaw’s blend of enthusiasms that made his Eden Project in Cornwall such a huge and popular success when it opened in 2001. It became a visitor attraction even before a single plant come into bloom in its huge greenhouses.\nInspired by the work of Buckminster Fuller, the maverick American author of Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, who had planned to cover most of Manhattan with a menacing-looking geodesic dome in order to protect the city from pollution, Grimshaw took what was an awful dystopian warning, and used it to create a welcoming landmark. His and Hunt’s cluster of geodesic steel structures, supporting inflatable transparent cells that could control the climate, transformed an abandoned china clay pit into a sprawling indoor landscape of subtropical gardens and rainforests, and reignited the economy of a faltering Cornish community.\nFor Grimshaw, the high tech approach was the way to turn the messy, earthbound and mud-soaked business of architecture into a kind of magic trick. He wanted to use modern materials to create lightweight, prefabricated components that could be put together in an instant, such as the Meccano construction kits that he had played with as a child.\nBorn in Hove, he was the son of Joan (nee Dearsley), a painter, and Thomas Grimshaw, an engineer. He went to Wellington college, in Berkshire, then studied architecture at Edinburgh College of Art and the Architectural Association in London. On graduation in 1965 he set up the Farrell Grimshaw Partnership with Terry Farrell. Their first commission was to turn a terrace of 19th-century houses near Paddington station into a student hostel. They craned in an ingenious free-standing steel, plastic and glass tower supporting a spiral ramp that contained enough bathrooms to service the whole block. Fuller came to see it for himself, and was impressed. Grimshaw, with his dandyish style, trademark blue spectacles, and flowing cavalier locks seemed to represent the fashionable London of the time.\nHe and Farrell went on to build a pioneering co-operative block of flats overlooking Regent’s Park, in which they both lived with their families for a period. Its crinkly metal skin was modelled on a Citroën van. It was followed by a stream of successful industrial buildings, including the Herman Miller factory in Bath and a number of social housing projects.\nWhile his contemporaries began to explore other ideas, Grimshaw’s architectural language stayed fundamentally consistent. His inspirations were naked aluminium, the imagery of the airship and the Airstream caravan. It was his determination to stick with one end of the architectural spectrum that contributed to his break-up with Farrell in the late 70s. The partnership ended, but both of them went on to build highly successful practices in their own ways.\nGrimshaw got his first project outside Britain when Rolf Fehlbaum, owner of the Vitra furniture company, asked him to plan a new industrial campus in Weil am Rhein, Germany, in 1981, setting the scene for work by Zaha Hadid, Frank Gehry and Tadao Ando. In 1988 Grimshaw built an impressive printing works for the Financial Times, and the practice later designed massive new airports for St Petersburg and Istanbul, as well as a car factory for Rolls-Royce and the National Space Centre in Leicester.\nWhen journalists asked Grimshaw about the “high tech” label that he was unable to escape, he would shrug. “Everybody should be building with the technology of their own age – the Edwardians were very high tech. It’s the way you look at how materials are put together that matters. To me, that is what makes for real architecture as opposed to scenery. Quinlan Terry once said he didn’t care what his buildings were made of so long as they looked Georgian. That just the opposite of what I’m about.”\nGrimshaw was always more interested in performance than in style or the symbolic meanings of architecture. “I like to think our approach is one you’d get from a good boat builder. It’s not the same boat every time, but you recognise that it’s from the same mind and hands.”\nLike so many architects, Grimshaw took real pleasure in sailing. He kept his boat in Norfolk, and treated sailing as much a research topic as a hobby. In one of his former studios, the main staircase was fabricated from an aluminium yacht mast. “What I find fascinating about boat design is that you can’t muck around … A boat has to be a boat, if it is not, it sinks. The appeal is the absolute functionality. And boats are beautiful because of that,” he told me.\nGrimshaw’s buildings have proved both functional and impressively adaptable. The FT print building is a data centre now. Miller’s furniture factory houses several departments of Bath Spa University.\nArchitecture is not an easy profession. When Grimshaw decided to stand for election as president of the Royal Academy, aged 65, he confessed that he had begun to weary of the more bureaucratic aspects of architectural practice. “I’ve been an architect for 40 years, and 80% of it is a battle. There are battles on-site, over legal issues, over financial matters, and with the client.” His spa project that was meant to be a glamorous new attraction for Bath remained empty and unused for several years because of legal wrangles with the contractor. There were also technical and legal issues at Waterloo station. Grimshaw’s plans for remodelling the Royal College of Art had to be abandoned, even though it had planning permission, when a wealthy neighbour threatened a legal challenge that the RCA could not afford to contest.\nGrimshaw was a highly effective president of the Royal Academy from 2004, bringing calm and stability to what was then a troubled organisation. He put in place financial controls and a professional management structure. He was also generous, making use of the role to give another architect the chance to excel – he abandoned the institution’s previous over-ambitious £50m plan to integrate the former Museum of Mankind building in Burlington Gardens with the Royal Academy, clearing the way for David Chipperfield’s successful remodelling.\nGrimshaw was knighted in 2002, elected as president of the Royal Academy of Arts in 2004 and awarded the RIBA gold medal for architecture in 2019, the year in which he handed over the chairmanship of the practice that he had founded.\nHe married Lavinia Russell in 1972, and she survives him, as do his two daughters, Isabel and Chloe.",

        "title": "‘You think rape’s your fault’: Oscar-winner Brenda Fricker on her devastating memoir",
        "content": "Brenda Fricker is sitting up in a bed plumped with pillows, wearing a sapphire blue blouse and a head of grey-golden ringlets. One bedside table has her medication, 25 pills a day. Another has a cup of water, an ashtray and her cigarettes. Above and on either side of her are shelves jammed with an eclectic hoard of books: Salman Rushdie, Edna O’Brien, Brian Aldiss, Alex Ferguson. Meanwhile, gazing out from framed black and white photographs on the walls, are writers, producers and actors from another era, plus a young, luminous Fricker herself.\nThe current version of Fricker is 80 and not so well, happy to be interviewed but only from the bed of her Dublin home – not exactly a common setup with stars, but then she is no ordinary star. “I’m out of breath just talking,” she says. “I’ve never known tiredness ever in my life. Weary. Will I ever get up again?” She will, but the question is not entirely rhetorical. “I’m having a dreadful death,” she says. “I’m just dying, every day in pain.” This is said in a matter of fact tone, only to be undercut by a rueful prediction: “I’ll probably live to be 100.”\nThe grande dame of Irish and British theatre, TV and cinema – Fricker was a staple of Coronation Street and Casualty, and won an Oscar for My Left Foot in 1990 – is an authority on survival. It is something of a miracle, in fact, that she made it into adulthood, let alone pensionable age. Fricker lit up the screen with warmth and light but her life was often cold and dark. At times she tried to end it, only to rediscover a hunger for love and joy and adventure. That spirit endures even though frailty has ambushed her and confined her to bed. She leans forward, blue eyes blazing. “Do everything while you’re young,” she says with fierce urgency. “Just do it.”\nHer younger self needed no urging. After stumbling into acting, she forged a remarkable career and collaborated with luminaries such as David Hare, Dirk Bogarde, Richard Harris and Daniel Day-Lewis, and in her Hollywood spell encountered Macaulay Culkin, Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump. Her greatest affection is for London’s bohemian yesteryear. “It was a drinking culture,” she says. “Everybody was pissed most of the time. Happy days.”\nThe reason for this interview, however, is Fricker’s new memoir, She Died Young: A Life in Fragments, which reveals a life scarred by abuse and sexual assault. Her parlous health means we rendezvous at her terrace home in the Liberties, an area of Dublin’s inner city. It is a bright and airy place, jumbled with books, plants, a dog and mementoes, including her Oscar, which props open a bathroom door. Carers visit daily. “They’re so good. Great, great women,” says Fricker.\nI sit down, a copy of her book peeking from my bag. “Did you read it?” she asks. I nod. “Oh God, this is terrifying,” she adds. “I don’t know how to do interviews about this.” The motivation for the memoir was not ego but money – to end a tangled saga of disputed debt – and it took four years of hard graft. “Every line I deleted and started again. It was murder for me. It was kind of ironic because I was talking about things I had paid a fortune to psychiatrists to make me forget. So it was very painful bringing them back. I thought they were a bit morbid. I think I’m a bit morbid. I’m Irish.”\nFricker was born in 1945 and grew up in the south Dublin suburb of Dundrum. Her father, Desmond, a journalist with the Irish Times and RTÉ, was an aloof, detached figure with his nose forever in a book. Her mother Bina was a schoolteacher who would on occasion erupt and assault Brenda. “She’d beat the shit out of me.” Decades later, doctors detected a brain tumour that they said might have caused erratic behaviour.\nDespite love and solace from relatives in Kerry and her free spirited, sparky older sister Gránia, Fricker was an anxious child prone to bed-wetting. At the age of eight, she befriended a 30-year-old bachelor – the memoir calls him Séamus S – from a theatre group. When he offered private elocution lessons, her delighted parents delivered her each week to his home.\nPerched on his sofa, she devoured cake while he taught her poems and read her books and answered her myriad questions. And then, over time, he had her hitch up her skirt and expose herself while he masturbated. The memoir, however, defends him. “So many of the happiest hours of my childhood were spent with him … our secret was the price I had to pay for the deep friendship that we shared.”\nI tell her that is shocking. She was eight. She nods. She accepts that she was groomed yet has no regrets. “It was a good deal for me because I was getting so much from him. I was a bright little kid, you know, curious about everything, and he never hurt me. He never touched me, he never frightened me.”\nFricker does not imply any connection but from the age of 10 she became obsessed by blood and blades and began to cut and scar herself as a way to assert some control, to have another secret. When she was 14, a horrific bicycle accident – she hurtled face-first through a car windscreen – landed her in hospital for two agonising years. The driver was to blame but his political connections meant the incident was hushed up, she says.\nFricker had excelled at Latin and algebra but the accident derailed schooling and she left without any qualifications, which bequeathed a lifelong inferiority complex. “A chip this size,” she says, arcing a hand over a shoulder. Decades of voracious reading have not filled the void. “It still wounds me. That’s how deep it goes.”\nAged 17, she was raped at a party, an act of violence and cruelty that left her “broken”. Trapped in a cycle of depression, self-harm and suicide attempts, she was institutionalised multiple times. Yet a zest for life endured. She dabbled in journalism, au paired in Spain and got a role on the Dublin stage, which led to theatre and television work on both sides of the Irish Sea.\nAnd then violence again found her. The memoir graphically details a rape by an English actor named James Donnelly. Like Fricker, he starred on Coronation Street, but at a different time, and died in 1992. When I mention the name, she goes quiet and reaches for a cigarette. “He was a bastard, yeah.” She did not report the assault to police. “Girls get raped and they’re ashamed of themselves. You think it’s your fault. You really do.”\nFricker welcomed the #MeToo movement as an overdue reckoning for abusers but has little confidence in much changing, saying: “It’ll go on for ever.”\nWhich brings us to Harvey Weinstein and My Left Foot. In 1989, she played the mother in this biopic of Christy Brown, a working-class Dubliner with cerebral palsy who became an acclaimed painter and writer. Weinstein championed the low-budget indie under his Miramax banner, leading to five Oscar nominations. Fricker lauds his promotional genius but still shudders at meeting him. “He put his arms around me and I thought I’d vomit. He just emanated something off. He was just disgusting, like a big, sweating pig.”\nDaniel Day-Lewis won best actor for playing Brown and Fricker won best supporting actress, a triumph that put Irish cinema on the map. For the girl from Dundrum, it was surreal – she rode in gigantic limousines and filled a suitcase with pilfered Beverly Hills hotel spoons as mementoes.\nHollywood roles followed, including in the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Macaulay Culkin was a charming, beautiful kid, and spoiled rotten by those around him, she says. “Of course he ended up on drugs, what else would he do?” Playing a homeless pigeon-lover, Fricker ended each day “covered in pigeon shit”. Returning to her suite at New York’s Plaza hotel one evening, she met Donald Trump in the elevator. “It was like I’d jumped into a pigsty but he was very polite about it. He just said, ‘How’s it going?’”\nHer career thrived but loss and grief never released their hold. She had a miscarriage and, without her permission, doctors removed her womb, so she never had children. Marriage to the film director Barry Davies ended in divorce. Her adored sister Gránia died an alcoholic at the age of 68, which inspired the title of Fricker’s memoir. Through it all, Fricker continued working: The Field, Veronica Guerin, I Married an Axe Murderer, Cloudburst, more than 30 films. A forthcoming feature called The Swallow, by Tadhg O’Sullivan, may be her swansong.\nFalls, broken bones, swollen joints, aches and fatigue keep her in bed. Unable to sleep at night, she binge-watches The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. “It’s better than sex,” she says. “It’s better than getting drunk. I just love it.”\nYet a passion for her craft endures, indomitable. She has not quite forgiven Day-Lewis for remaining in character – in a wheelchair, grunting – for the entire shoot of My Left Foot. A disruptive indulgence, she says. “I’m fond of him. A good man, great morals. But he’s a fucking method actor. I mean, we all have a method. I don’t mind another method actor but if they interfere with my little method, then fuck off, like, you know?” Fricker sighs and smiles. “I’ll be getting a phone call from Daniel. He phones me on occasion, tells me I’m being bold.”\nAs I leave Fricker in her bed, a tousled queen in her Dublin kingdom looking back on eight extraordinary decades, it’s not a verdict I would quibble with.\nShe Died Young: A Life in Fragments by Brenda Fricker is out tomorrow.\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "title": "US liberal philanthropies condemn political violence and defend their work",
        "content": "More than 100 liberal philanthropies and institutions have issued a letter condemning “acts of political violence” and pre-emptively opposing an expected Trump administration crackdown on ideologically left-leaning funding in the wake of the death of Charlie Kirk last week.\nThe groups, including the Ford Foundation and George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, denounced the recent murders of Kirk and of Melissa Hortman in Minnesota, saying such acts “have no place in our democracy”.\nThe letter – published on Medium – said: “Our country is built on the premise that everyone has the right to express themselves, even when others don’t agree with or like what they say. No one should fear for their safety simply for expressing their views.”\nIt went on to warn that “organizations should not be attacked for carrying out their missions or expressing their values in support of the communities they serve.\n“We reject attempts to exploit political violence to mischaracterize our good work or restrict our fundamental freedoms, like freedom of speech and the freedom to give. Attempts to silence speech, criminalize opposing viewpoints, and misrepresent and limit charitable giving undermine our democracy and harm all Americans.”\nThe statement comes after officials in the Trump administration signaled a potential crackdown on unnamed left-leaning groups it claims promote violence and terrorism.\nStanding in as host of the Charlie Kirk Show podcast on Monday, JD Vance said that “leftwing extremism” was “part of the reason” Kirk was assassinated last week.\n“We have to talk about this incredibly destructive movement of leftwing extremism that has grown up over the last few years and, I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin’s bullet,” the vice-president said.\nVance called out the “generous tax treatment” that Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation receive, pointing to a report in the Nation, titled Charlie Kirk’s Legacy Deserves No Mourning, that he claimed was used to justify Kirk’s death and part of a campaign to incite violence against conservatives.\n“I read a story in the Nation magazine about my dear friend Charlie Kirk,” Vance said during the podcast. “George Soros’ Open Society Foundation funds this magazine, as does the Ford Foundation and many other wealthy titans of the American progressive movement.”\nElsewhere on the podcast, the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, claimed that Kirk’s final message to him called for a coordinated effort against unnamed leftwing groups accused of promoting violence. Miller pledged that the federal government would use “every available resource” to dismantle them.\nA senior White House official told the Washington Post it was compiling a list of “leftwing organizations” that it says are linked to political violence but had not decided on what actions it may seek to take.\nBhaskar Sunkara, the president of the Nation, said on X that the publication had never received funds from the Open Society Foundations. Both the Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation said they do not currently fund the Nation. A spokesperson for the Open Society Foundations called Vance’s accusations “disgraceful” and said the group’s work was “entirely peaceful and lawful”.\nThe author of the opinion piece, Elizabeth Spiers, later said her article “explicitly stated that no one should ever be killed for their views” and suggested Vance either misunderstood her piece or was deliberately misrepresenting her words.\nIn her article, Spiers described Kirk as “an unrepentant racist, transphobe, homophobe, and misogynist who often wrapped his bigotry in Bible verses because there was no other way to pretend that it was morally correct”.\nThe dispute comes as the administration seeks to bind itself tightly to Kirk’s legacy. Trump, Vance and the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, are expected to travel to Arizona for Kirk’s stadium-set memorial service on Sunday.\nThe agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, are also expected to attend.\nThe letter published on Wednesday now seeks to defuse the conflict between the administration and progressive philanthropies and non-profits by joining together to form a collective front that has eluded other institutions and businesses, including universities and law firms, that have come under administration pressure.\nSignatories to the letter, include the MacArthur Foundation; the Knight Foundation; the Omidyar Network, funded by the eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar; and the Schmidt Family Foundation, supported by the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.\n“At a moment that is fragile and fraught, we must rise to the higher standard we all collectively desire,” the letter concluded.\n“Now is a moment for leadership that drives unity rather than sows further division. Our organizations will continue focusing on helping people across all backgrounds, geographies, ideologies, and belief systems, to heal, thrive, and live peacefully together, protected by the freedoms guaranteed in our Constitution.”",

        "title": "‘I got Coldplayed!’: how the Jumbotron claimed another unwitting victim",
        "content": "Name: Getting Coldplayed.\nAge: The original incident happened on 16 July this year.\nAppearance: Rumbled, sheepish and guilty.\nCome on, we’re not still talking about those cheating execs captured on camera at a middle-of-the-road stadium rock gig? We’ve had our fun, they haven’t (both resigned and at least one is getting divorced). Time to move on. I would, but it’s happened again.\nSurely they wouldn’t be foolish enough to get caught on screen again? No, someone else did: American football fan Jeff Comeaux. His facial expressions were so entertaining at a recent game between his team, the Tennessee Volunteers, and the Georgia Bulldogs that the Jumbotron operator kept filming him, and he went viral.\nSo far, so 2025. What’s the problem? Comeaux had called in sick to go to the game and his employer spotted him in a meme online.\nThat’s awkward. Very much so. “I got Coldplayed,” Comeaux said.\nDid his team win at least? No.\nOh dear. Still, I like how “Coldplayed” is a verb now! Have there been other Coldplayings?\nThere was another incident involving a fan caught kissing his companion (who turned out not to be his girlfriend) at a football game in Ecuador 2020, then jumping away from her shamefacedly when he saw himself on the big screen; he later pleaded for his partner to take him back. Something similar seemed to happen at a Houston Astros baseball game in 2021 – a man with his arm around a woman spotted they were on camera and immediately sidled away looking awfully guilty, to the internet’s delight.\nHmm, this is a bit depressing, as if we’re extracting bleak crumbs of entertainment from human folly and unhappiness. Chill out, Tolstoy. Would some funny Coldplay Jumbotron Incident parodies help? There are whole reels of them on YouTube now. Some even feature giant fluffy mascots!\nNo. Does nothing nice happen on big screens? Yes, sometimes there are marriage proposals! Only last month, a man proposed on screen during a US Open tennis match; when the woman said yes after a tantalising wait, the whole place went wild.\nAwww, sweet. That’s more like it. Although other such public proposals haven’t gone so well. In 2017, one captured on the big screen at a baseball game in Boston ended up with the couple fighting and, reportedly, the crowd chanting: “She said no.”.\nI’m starting to think the moral of the story is that it might not be a good idea to let unpredictable, intimate moments from your personal life appear on a vast screen in front of tens of thousands of spectators? That seems sensible advice. Especially for Coldplay fans: the band have 138 more shows planned for their tour and the Jumbotron is here to stay: “We are going to keep doing it,” Chris Martin has said.\nDo say: “In the future, everyone will be caught on the Jumbotron for 15 seconds.”",

        "title": "What’s the best way to apologise? I’m sorry, but I disagree with the newest suggestion...",
        "content": "A bloke in a service station once said something really horrible to me. But he swiftly followed it up with one of the most sincere apologies I’ve ever been on the end of. This was at Hopwood Park services on the M42, years ago. I’d just pulled up at the pump. Clocking me, he knocked on the passenger window, and when I opened it he stuck his head in and said something vile. It could have been classed as banter, I suppose, but it was still vile. My two young children were in the back, all wide-eyed in bafflement. Upset more than angry, I got out, filled up and went to pay, only to find him waiting by the car when I returned. He put his hand on my shoulder and said, “I’m sorry mate. I didn’t know you had your kids in the car. I apologise for that.” There was something about the last four words which made the difference, somehow adding just the right amount of emphasis.\nI wasn’t particularly pleased to have such a memory stirred this week when I read about a research paper, published by the British Psychological Society, on how the length of the words you use when you make an apology are important in conveying your sincerity. Apologies always fascinate me because, as far as I can see, without contrition on one side and forgiveness on the other, we’re all doomed.\nAt middle school I had a science teacher who talked about the concept of decay. He said if leaves didn’t decay, we’d be up to our armpits in them. I feel the same about apologies – if they’re not made and accepted, we’ll all be up to our armpits in bad stuff. Accordingly, I’m one of those people whose anger and disappointment about something somebody has said or done will usually disappear the moment somebody says sorry. I don’t know whether this makes me a nice person, or rather shallow. Conversely, if I’m the one doing the apologising, and the apology isn’t accepted, I get very angry and disappointed indeed, which isn’t really cricket either.\nThe study, which looked at written rather than verbal sorries, concludes that people who use longer words in their apologies are more likely to communicate sincerity. So, saying you’re “genuinely” sorry is better than “really” sorry. Apparently the “greater production effort” involved in delivering those two extra syllables does make a slight difference. By this measure, the French are way ahead of us. They really do put their backs into their apologies. When the French for a simple “I am sorry” is something as dramatic and rather beautiful as “Je suis désolé”, you wonder where they go from there. What do you say if you feel more than merely desolate about whatever you’re saying sorry for? A friend of mine in Paris says he’d go for “Je vous prie d’accepter mes excuses les plus sincères”, meaning, “I beg you to accept my most sincere apologies”. Now that’s what I call a production effort. OK, whatever, chill out, je vous pardonne, no problem.\nBe it in person or on the page, for me less is more. Just “sorry” will do. “I am sorry”, if you must. And OK, if you’ve really done me over you can throw in a very, a genuinely, or even an abjectly. But any more than that and I’ll start to suspect you have wronged me more badly than I realised.\nI should say that, as with most academic papers, much of the language in which this one is written is quite beyond me. For example, something called iconicity keeps coming up. There are 290,000 words defined in my Chambers dictionary, and iconicity isn’t one of them. But I pressed on regardless and hope I’ve got the gist of it over correctly. If I haven’t, perhaps Shiri Lev-Ari, cognitive psychologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, could get in touch so I can apologise to her at whatever length she desires.",

        "title": "How the EU’s far right has seized on Charlie Kirk’s killing",
        "content": "Before his fatal shooting, few if any of the leaders of Europe’s resurgent far right had so much as mentioned the name of Charlie Kirk. Since last week, the propaganda potential of the conservative US activist’s killing has escaped none of them.\nKirk, a rising star of Donald Trump’s Maga movement, was hit in the neck by a single bullet as he addressed students in Utah on 10 September. A 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, has been charged, but his alleged motives remain unclear.\nBut that has not stopped far-right figureheads from across the continent seizing on the killing to attack “the left”, presenting Kirk’s death as the logical conclusion of what they portray as a long-running hate campaign aimed at silencing them.\n“We must stop the hate-mongering left!” said Hungary’s illiberal prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Santiago Abascal of Spain’s Vox went further: “Censorship isn’t enough for them – so they resort to murder.”\nFor Jordan Bardella of France’s far-right National Rally (RN), the “dehumanising rhetoric of the left and its intolerance … fuels political violence”. Alice Weidel of Germany’s AfD said Kirk had been shot by “a fanatic who hates our way of life”.\nThe objective, experts say, is to raise Kirk to the status of a martyr to the conservative cause, and a victim of liberal-progressive persecution – simultaneously lending greater legitimacy to the right’s positions, and inflicting damage on the left.\n“Martyrdom is a social operation to transform a morally and socially unacceptable act of violence into a narrative,” historian Pierre-Marie Delpu told Le Monde. “Here, the far right is constructing a plot and a persecution, with one executioner: the left.”\nSome on Europe’s far right were disarmingly open about the business of capitalising on the killing. “We should not be ashamed of ‘politicising [Kirk’s] death’ – or putting a tragedy to good use,” urged Damien Rieu, an adviser to Marine Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal.\nIn the European parliament, the ultranationalist Europe of Sovereign Nations group, which includes AfD and France’s Reconquête, nominated Kirk for the Sakharov prize, awarded annually for “the defence of human rights and fundamental liberties”.\nMobilising the base\nAt a far-right gathering hosted by Vox in Madrid last weekend, a stirring video tribute to Kirk wowed the audience. To loud cheers, Abascal told an estimated 8,500 people that the left “do not kill us for being fascists – they call us fascists in order to kill us”.\nAndré Ventura of Portugal’s Chega said the killing showed “arguing over ideas” had given way to “hatred, persecution and murder”. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, told the rally that Kirk’s “sacrifice … shows us once again which side the violence and intolerance are on … We will continue to fight tirelessly for our people’s freedom.”\nIn London, the 110,000 to 150,000 people who attended Tommy Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” protest on Saturday – including far-right figures from France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland and Germany – held a minute’s silence for their hero.\nA continent on the march\nThis all might matter less if Europe’s far right were not already on the march. Populist and far-right parties are in government in Italy, Hungary, Belgium and Slovakia, and the most popular parties in France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and the UK.\nIn Finland and Croatia they are signed-up members of conservative-led coalitions, and in Sweden they are lending parliamentary support to another. In Spain, Vox is surging in the polls and in Portugal, Chega is in the lead ahead of local elections.\nIn German regional elections in North Rhine-Westphalia last Saturday, AfD was well beaten by chancellor Friedrich Merz’s centre-right CDU and his Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners – but the far-right party succeeded in almost tripling its vote.\nMore insidiously, hardline far-right policies – on immigration, Islam, the green agenda, EU integration, traditional values – are becoming normalised across Europe as mainstream parties ape them in a vain attempt to maintain their vote shares.\nHolding the line\nIn a passionate op-ed for Le Monde, the French MEP and former European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau – who received death threats after objecting to the far right’s calls for a minute’s silence for Kirk – said that while Kirk’s killing was an abomination, he had “glorified racial segregation and slavery, demanded women return to the home, demonised homosexuality, blamed Jews for promoting immigration … and compared abortion to the Holocaust”.\nShe was, she said, the only one of 720 MEPs “to speak out and demand that a distinction be made between the unanimous condemnation we should all express in the face of a man’s assassination, and the refusal to endorse his ideas”.\nIn the present circumstances, Loiseau said, resisting the concerted call for Kirk’s martyrdom – “keeping our heads, remaining true to what we are” – is of paramount importance.\nBecause “it is not respect for the dead they demand; it’s the right to insult and hate the living who do not resemble them … It is not freedom of speech they defend, it is the normalisation of their extremism. In America, as in Europe.”",
